TODO: Create a webscraper that scrapes each episode review in the given url. 

what to scrape:
1. the review
2. helpfulness
3. dislikes
4. total votes (helpfulness + dislikes)
5. date of the review being created
6. title of the review
7. number of rating
8. name of the director
9. runtime of the episode

Idea:
1. how about make a universal scraper? maksudnya you can input any different type of movie
and scrape the same thing as above list.

well ok, then you can to check each type of the title ex: series/movie.
