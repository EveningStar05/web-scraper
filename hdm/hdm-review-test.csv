25 December 2019,"Review of Series One:The first series of HIS DARK MATERIALS is a more true-to-the-novel adaptation of Philip Pullman's NORTHERN LIGHTS than the Hollywood flick THE GOLDEN COMPASS. Over eight episodes, Lyra's story plays out with a particular effort to bring all of the remarkable visuals and vistas to life, thanks in part to the BBC's collaboration with American producers. It's not a perfect story, lacking something in the characterisation - which feels more hollow than on the page - and in the quality of the performances, particularly the central one which I found extremely bland. However, the calibre of the CGI effects is very good and the story moves at a strong place, shining with some good suspense sequences such as the cat-and-mouse antics in Ruth Wilson's apartment. Somewhat inevitably, it's not as good as the book, but it does the job well enough.",5/10

Somewhat inevitably, it's not as good as the book, but it does the job well enough.The second series is a major letdown and the quality has just vanished. It seems cheaper and more slapdash, and they've played with the story so that a lot of it is unrecognisable compared to the book. All the good stuff seems to have been excised so that we're left with long dialogue scenes that smack of boredom. The only interesting bits that remain are those that are recognisable from the Pullman novel. It's the same thing that happened with the Harry Potter movies from four onwards; just going through the motions, focusing on CGI at the expense of making the viewer feel something. The last episode in particular is a real anticlimax.",5/10
20 August 2020,"Rom the beginning, we know Lyra (Dafne Keen )is special and will destroy the world order run by the Magisterium. She is raised in Jordan College in Oxford in an alternative reality. People have a daemon which is a talking animal that houses their soul. Kids are being kidnapped and there is this portal between worlds and this dust thing.The plot confounds science, magic, and theology going where Harry Potter would dare not. At times Lyra had the poise of Hermione, however, looking like the goofy kid from witness ruined it. She needed to be special looking and a better actress. Yes, long blonde hair and her mother the same. I didn't like any of the major characters, I couldn't get into the scenes. There is a light political statement about scholastic sanctuary having to separate from the state and a question on the fall of man. The message was read. I believe the film might be too confusing for the target audience.",6/10
24 January 2020,"When I started watching ""His Dark Materials"", I noticed that it shared a lot of similarities with ""The Golden Compass"", and then realized that they shared a source material. When I saw ""The Golden Compass"" many years ago, it reminded me of the Harry Potter series, as the children resist all manner of treachery and deceit at the hands of powerful adults.As you may expect, the series is able to go into more detail about the characters (full disclosure: I haven't read any of the books). Having just watched the first season, I'm so far impressed.When Philip Pullman wrote the books and created Marisa Coulter, he probably never guessed that a similar Coulter (Ann) would soon rise to prominence.",8/10
6 November 2019,"Rubbish quite simply.The BBC have overhyped this massively, almost ramming it down audiences' throats in a ""you must love this"" manner.And what do we end up with? A fairly decent drama, nothing special.",2/10
22 November 2019,"I only watched the first episode of this series, which I recognized, after a few moments of ""wait, why is this familiar?"", as the same set of events as the movie The Golden Compass, which I saw years ago and can't recall what I thought of.Anyway, it's a fantasy with air ships and a mysterious substance and intrigue and I found it all very slow and the characters didn't grab me. It might get better but I don't feel inclined to keep going to find out.",6/10
27 September 2020,"Plot: An alternative world controlled by the magisterium where human souls turn into animal companions, i.e. Daemon spirits becoming animals capable of transforming into different species. After the great flood a special savior child is placed in a school for protection. It's her journey we experience.Neutral: Usual steampunk floating airships as our future prop. Usual mystery device (Alethiometer) a handheld brass clock (hands, gears, symbols) as our truth telling magic helper. The usual witch presence. Usual windows (portals) into what appears to be parallel worlds, but more realistic than the usual rectangle.Negative: The science embedded in the storyline is shaky at best. But, I'll excuse it as highly impossible fantasy thinking.
Positives: To those who want faithfulness in movie adaptations of books. Not possible as the medium is different, and each offers its own benefits. Acting, sets, props, costuming all well done. The detail in the sets, props (realistic dirt & aging) - outstanding. The costuming was natural (not the fake synthetic naugahyde usually offered). The CGI was as good as it gets - unbelievably realistic.",6/10
2 September 2021,"Seems bland compared to the 1st year; very repetitive, disjointed storyline as we jump around. Storyline & acting seemed rehearsed, shallow & staged. After a year the producers should give a clear synopsis of last year events, as well as an update on the vast array of characters (Spectres, Angels, Authority, Witches, Magisterium).They added a character to satisfy teen viewers in a potential love interest (Note: Can't a female be successful on her own?). CGI not as prevalent as season 1, and again just reused. A Subtle knife to cut between parallel multiverses is different, but scientifically just dumbing down the viewers as its a physical impossibility.",6/10
17 February 2020,"17 February 2020When viewing an adaptation of something you read, especially if you are a fan of the source material and know it by heart, you subconsciously intertwine the book and the adaptation, and often do not notice the holes in the script because your foreknowledge fills them. I guess the high rating of this series comes right from Pullman's fans. To me, who have not read the book, the first season of ""His Dark Materials"" wasn't boring. I enjoyed the visual appeal of the series, though it doesn't come anywhere close to ""Game of Thrones"" I just finished a few days ago, the interesting characters and the action, but to ask me what it's about - honestly, I have no idea. The first season raises countless questions and gives little to no answers. Everything is vague, confusing and without much sense. If they wanted it to be a mystery that unfolds in the end, the end that is coming in a few seasons, they should have given us at least some hints and cliffhangers that would motivate us to wait for the next season. It may be just me, but even though the series is within my favorite genre, I'm not at all interested in waiting for the continuation. That may change if in the meantime I find the time and the will to read the book, but by itself, without foreknowledge of the story, the series left me completely indifferent.6/1005 January 2021After the end of the second season, everything written above still stands, but still, it left a somewhat stronger impression, both visually and story-wise. Except for the nonsensical last episode ...7/10",7/10
17 November 2019,"Incredibly enjoyable, entertaining and phenomenal! Dafne Keen and James McAvoy are superb! The writing and acting is on point with so much brilliance and plenty of high hopes of more greatness to come. His Dark Materials is impeccable on HBO, I don't know much about the story quite yet but the pilot is a leap in the right direction.",9/10
29 December 2020,"4 out of 5 stars.Second season continues this epic storytelling as Lyra and Will travel between wars. Meeting dangerous threats. Will learning his purpose. While the witches and others are trying to protect Lyra. While the threat looms closer.It is a bit complex plot with a lot going on. Sometimes moments that does get little uninspired in slow parts. But overall, Jack Thorne script manages to build an epic fantasy world. Great visual effects. Production values. Great cast ensemble. And thrilling moments. There is a post credit scene to the season finale that will leave you goosebumps. I am excited for the third season. And sad that it may be concluding with only having three novels.",8/10
15 January 2020,"The series version of the book series covered pretty much a good length of the book and it built a good atmosphere about the worlds and dust. However, there were elements that were not properly explained. Still, the performances were good. The CGI were excellent too.",7/10
6 January 2020,"Leave it to writers and directors to screw up a good thing. Everything was fine until the end of episode five, then kaboom. Total CFBR!The lack of attention to detail is the failure of the director and writers. I won't bother going in to detail about the major screw ups, but holy mackerel, they really screwed up.Overall everything was fine until the end of the fifth episode. I thought it would resolved itself in the sixth episode but it didn't, which really ruined everything for me.The rest of the show is pointless but I will watch the remaining season.",5/10
21 February 2021,"What we have here is a dark magic fueled fantasy in a world full of.... News Commentary.That's right, HBO made yet another show that is ripped straight from the headlines to make sure you know what to think.... but set in a fantasy world.This is CNN with magic. This is MSNBC with horror. This is Fox News with flat acting.What it isn't, however, is entertaining. Political Lectures about identity politics aren't entertainment. It's exactly what we see in the news, and, frankly, people watch television shows to escape real life and the news, and this makes fantasy escapism into an Op-Ed.So... watch it if you are into news commentary. Avoid it if you want entertainment and escapism.",1/10
11 November 2019,"You'd better believe it Lyra,things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.
You're going to need Pan to cling to when the going gets tough.
You've already seen your uncle nearly poisoned,your friend Roger kidnapped ad the woman you had begun to trust set her Daemon on yours( a gross breach of etiquette to say the least).
And you're still in Oxford.
You may be The Chosen One but it ain't going to be easy.
And now you know who your father is - what other secrets does Mrs Coulter
hide?
'His dark materials' is already after two episodes departing from the text to a large extent but the trilogy is good enough to stand it.
There is so much to look forward to that even with a spoiler warning I will not discuss forthcoming events.
Suffice it to say that this as a superb adaptation to one of the great works of
British literature.
As an aside,I will say that a theoretical physicist told me some years ago that
the discovery of Quantum Physics makes it practically certain that millions of a
alternative universes exist alongside one another so maybe the storyline isn't so fantastic after all.",10/10
15 February 2020,"This is a marvelous series for those who love fantastic adventures. Spectacular cast. Wonderful performances. Dafne Keen was a revelation in LOGAN and, now, she has matured into a multi-dimensional actor. Ruth Wilson is brilliant, as always. An intriguing premise and storytelling. Convincing special effects. I give this series a 10 (wonderful) out of 10. This has already been renewed and my hope is that they take on the whole series of books. {Fantasy Adventure}",10/10
21 May 2020,"So glad they made this into a TV adaptation, otherwise I'd have to actually read these books!I mostly watched this out of curiosity because I was that generation of British children who had this pushed down my throat from all sides but couldn't stick with it because it is just not compellingly written regardless of how nuanced it supposedly is.The world building is simple and doesn't make the mistake the movie made by shoving in a trilogy's worth of world building at the expense of story telling, though I would still say the movie is better overall.The world they're in looks cool though. They've gone for this darkish color palette while they're in the city but the arctic landscape is immersive and captivating as well. The design of this world, where we get a sort of technologically futuristic world but with a roaring twenties/art deco aesthetic is very refreshing and works enchantingly. I wish I knew more about who these ""Gyptians"" are (are they meant to be Romani?, who are they!?).The story has similar issues that I remember from the book. It doesn't quite understand the difference between being intriguing and just being confusingly esoteric about its inner workings. The story threads regarding clerical corruption are pretty dry and bureaucratic and our main plot isn't too much better.I always found it jarring and tiresome how they seem to begin with this discourse on other worlds and the tediously names ""dust"" (I know the simplicity is the point but still) only to then veer into a seemingly unrelated story about kidnapped children. It takes them way too long to get going with this and there are way too many soap opera style confrontations and reveals along the way.But finally they get to the arctic and there the fun really begins. There is this cool guy with a Hare companion. Why wasn't this who thing about him? Oh on that notem Lyra is a much better character than in the book. In the book she was utterly forgettable, but her she has a lot more personality. Shame it's kind of an obnoxious personality. I guess it 's going to be some kind of character arc but until she gets humbled by something you just have to put up with her. She is admittedly played quite adorably and the director of this show has a strange obsession with showing her in the bath.The sixth episode is by far the best since we get to where we want to be and find ourselves at a material and emotional climax. And then we find we have two episodes to go...the entire seventh episode feels pretty anti-climactic because of this. The final episode might have been devastating if I'd had any emotional investment in any of these characters.Maybe I'm missing something, but any subtext here has kind of alluded me. It annoys me how Lyra has this ""chosen one"" role in the story but then again there were written in the '90s. The whole truth watch...I'm just not sure what to make of it. Just seems like a cheat code by Pullman so he doesn't have to think of how they came up with the plan or found out what conveniences the plot for them to know.Intelligently, they introduce the series' deuteragonist. He didn't appear until second book. This strikes me as a much more logical narrative structure and is so much more efficient.In conclusion, this far from ideal but it's enjoyable viewing when you have your dinner on your lap. If parts don't work, it's still interesting to see what works and what doesn't so you can still get an enjoyment of sorts from it.I want to say something nice about the theme music too...I guess I already have.",6/10
6 November 2019,"Like the film this series won't please everyone. Its theme of reason and logic ruling over superstition, fear and spiritualism, will have a certain demographic hot and bothered. Which, when you think about it, is rather absurd, if their faith is as powerful as they claim.Lets start by saying this is, a well rendered series. Its beautifully set, has a sterling cast, outstanding cinematography and a story well worth re-telling. The BBC are very much on target with His Dark Materials, in every sense.If there is a downside, its perhaps that the story can seem a little complex and overwhelming, for a newcomer. This is intelligent, thoughtful writing for a younger audience. Its not passive viewing. That said, its very accessible to anyone and as an adult, I 'm enjoying it thus far.Comes highly recommended. 10/10.",10/10
27 November 2019,Initial Impression - Spectacular cast. Wonderful performances. An intriguing premise and storytelling. Convincing special effects.

27 April 2020,The first couple of episodes set the series up nicely and while it remained visually spectacular it never really kicked on story wise it was more of a drag with some decent performances but nothing to truly blow you away. It wasn't awful and had its moments but I honestly thought they might have done the books justice this time but for me they missed the mark with both the pace and atmospheric feel throughout despite the fantastic visuals. Hopefully season 2 improves further.,6/10
12 November 2019,"It might seem logical to avid bookworms but for a novice to this material its like over complicated garbage. Watched episode one and two but not sure what its about its not really a kids movie but then again not sure most adults would like it either. I think is something to do with the animals souls and re-carnation and It said theirs witches and the girl is the chosen one in opening scroll. Then they started taking about dust and it gets a bit weird. gobblers have taken a Billy Costa an egyption boy. I am going to give it another try but its a hard watch. The golden compass was such a flop so not sure if this is going to be better, but then again some people will watch it just because they like the animals. This week their talking about spyflys station and cliffgast and the bad people including girls mum are trying to stop children reaching puberty. Billy costa is now dead and the girl has fallen from a hot air balloon.",6/10
14 November 2019,"Never heard of any of the books but some fantasies appeal to me. The story is strange and one has to give it time to find out whether you enjoy it or not. It is listed as an adventure, drama and family show. None of these worked for me, though the production and scenery is well done.",3/10
20 May 2020,"This is the first time the novels by Philip Pullman have been adapted into a television series. The previous film adaptation, The Golden Compass (2007), was once cited by author George R.R. Martin as one of the reasons he wanted Game of Thrones (2011) to be a television series, rather than a feature film.
I can understand why he thought that as compared to the ill fated never completed ""Golden Compass."" ""His Dark Materials "" is a masterpiece.
The 2007 movie adaptation costing an estimated $180,000,000 USD that director Chris Weitz revealed years after release that despite him being a fan of the books, making the movie was a ""terrible experience"" for him because New Line Cinema constantly interfered. Weitz' original script had a much slower pace, allowing for more world-building, character development, and exposition. The studio forced him to scrap elements that weren't immediately essential to the plot, and tone down the religious subtext. They also overruled several casting decisions and took over editing to get the running time under two hours, which necessitated re-shoots and the re-arranging of several other scenes to make the film coherent again. The most radical intervention was removing the original downbeat ending from the final cut, intending to use it as the opening of a proposed sequel (which never happened)."" His Dark Materials."" Is estimated to cost $7 million USD per episode so at 8 episodes in series One it's a third of the cost of The Golden Compass but the quality and casting is impeccable author Phillip Pullman and Screen adaptor and Jack Thorne must be thrilled with the final result.
A brief explanation of this intriguing and fascinating imaginative tale written for both older children and Adults introduces us to Lyra a young girl who is destined to liberate her world from the grip of the Magisterium which represses people's ties to magic and their animal spirits known as daemons. Lyra's search for a kidnapped friend uncovers a sinister plot involving stolen children, and turns into a quest to understand a mysterious phenomenon called Dust.
Five Directors including Tom Hooper have created the two alternate worlds where our journey leads us with stunning visuals and combined CGI that compliments without taking away from the human actors.
The whole ensemble cast is so impressive especially 14 year old (at the time) Dafne Keen as Lyra and Ruth Wilson as Mrs Coulter also Anne -Marie Duff as Ma Costa .
The male cast members James Avoy as Lord Asriel and wonderful Lin -Manuel Miranda who gives a great performance which reminded me of Indiana Jones cast here in the role of Lee Scorsbey are both perfectly cast.
I'm glad I have only 6 months to wait for the second series that's already in the can as the Producers were concerned that Dafne Keen may look too old for the role if they delayed shooting.
I really loved this fantasy adventure and recommend it to all ages I found there were so many comparisons to events happening in our world today especially the mind games and control some Religions , Governments,and media play in our lives.
There isn't a release date for His Dark Materials season two, but don't expect too long a wait as filming had mostly finished before the first season even premiered - a fact that has also helped the series dodge the filming restrictions of the UK lockdown. Lee Scoresby actor Lin Manuel-Miranda tweeted that he had completed work on the follow-up season as early as 27th September 2019, and the rest of the cast were done by mid-December.",9/10
29 December 2019,"Original Review
(based on the season's first five episodes handed to press)HBO is back with the show that was supposed to take over Game of Thrones' massive success. His Dark Materials' debut season was a good start (review here), but its complex, layered storylines didn't all mix up together that well. It's an extremely dense narrative, one that Jack Thorne (the sole writer of season one) had some trouble nailing it. Now, not only does he bring Francesca Gardiner, Sarah Quintrell, Namsi Khan, and Lydia Adetunji to help him co-write the episodes, but Francesca even wrote the entire fifth chapter. Last season also had five different directors, while this one has Jamie Childs and Leanne Welham in control of the whole season.So, before I jump to the review itself, just a little clarification: this is indeed a *** spoiler-free review for season two, but it might address spoilers of the first season ***. I'm also trusting the official trailer for this season as a guideline to what is part of the viewers' general knowledge of the narrative that's going to be developed across the next seven episodes, including which actors/characters show up as well as the basic premise of each story. That said, my expectations were moderately high for the continuation of Lyra's adventure and her connection to the famous prophecy. I binged the first five episodes in one afternoon... what does this mean?It means His Dark Materials' second season is incredibly captivating. Usually, I try to watch press releases in the same manner as the audience will once the show starts getting broadcasted, but time wasn't kind to me, so I found myself with the necessity of binging the episodes instead of watching one or two per day. This method didn't feel forced at all, much on the contrary. Every episode is either packed with action or impactful narrative decisions that keep moving the plot forward. With the exception of one seemingly irrelevant subplot (I'll get there), every character has an exciting storyline that affects the main narrative.Contrary to the last season, where Lyra was pretty much the only character who controlled the show's pacing, this season gives other characters important things to do, especially Will Parry and a new character from the latter's world, Dr. Mary Malone (Simone Kirby). Will and Lyra inevitably cross paths and work together to find out what mysteries lie in the new world they travel to at the last season's finale. Their relationship goes through the necessary build-up and development, being the key ingredient of the season's success. As the protagonists, Dafne Keen and Amir Wilson share great chemistry, which is vital if the show wants the audience to feel their powerful bond.Will's role is much more impactful this season, maybe even more than Lyra's. If the first season was a nice, slow introduction to what Philip Pullman created in his novel series, the second one is a beacon of new, relevant data not only about the characters but about the rules of the ""multiverse"". From traveling between worlds to a shocking mission involving an object as important as the Alethiometer, passing through the first appearance of John Parry (Andrew Scott) and Mrs. Coulter's relentless search for her daughter, I still found Dr. Mary Malone's arc to be the most significant subplot of the whole show.As an engineer myself, science was and will always be an area of great interest. Simone Kirby is excellent in portraying the physicist. Her current academic research and her past connection to religion end up delivering a game-changing discovery. Despite the season's overall writing still being focused on unnecessary exposition and basic dialogues, the big moments are all nailed perfectly. Every episode is remarkably engaging, and all end in a way that leaves the viewer craving immediately for the next chapter. Action is always present, so expect a couple of nail-biting situations and surprising outcomes.Regarding the cast, Dafne Keen clearly shows signs of improvement, even if she started filming the second season right after the first one ended. Just like Amir Wilson, both carry much more expressiveness and emotion now, but Amir still needs to up his game. Their interactions are entertaining, to say the least. Ruth Wilson was the standout performance of last season, and she continues to prove her undeniable talent as the menacing, scary Mrs. Coulter (who keeps me questioning her true intentions). Ariyon Bakare has more screentime as Lord Carlo Boreal, who brings a lot of trouble to our protagonists, contrary to Dr. Mary Malone, who helps Lyra (and the viewers) to understand why the show is called His Dark Materials, and much more.These four characters are the wheels of this season, and most of each episode's runtime is spent with them. Their own storylines form the main narrative. However, I believe two other subplots can hurt the season if the last two episodes don't use them properly. One features Lee Scoresby (Lin-Manuel Miranda), who ends up joining with John Parry. Having hugely acclaimed actors in a television show is great to grab viewers, but it might be a misleading marketing scheme.For example, James McAvoy only shows up in two episodes during the first season, and he's nowhere to be seen in this one (even though I do acknowledge that COVID-19 supposedly impacted a standalone episode featuring Lord Asriel that couldn't be filmed). A similar circumstance occurs with Lin-Manuel Miranda, who still has a relevant side story, but his screentime is lamentably short. The other subplot involves the witches and the Magisterium. Ruta Gedmintas is amazing as Serafina Pekkala, but this whole war drama with the Magisterium only serves as a filler story, at least for now. I didn't find this story enthralling compared to everything else going on, even though some of the best visuals and cinematography of the entire show are demonstrated here.Technically, HBO rarely disappoints, and the production crew is packed with immensely skilled people. Joel Devlin and David Higgs are responsible for the gorgeous cinematography, offering a sort of cinematic atmosphere distinct from other TV shows. Lorne Balfe's score remains remarkably addictive, not due to overwhelming music but due to its subtlety throughout the entire series. It's also seamlessly edited by everyone involved in this task. Jamie Childs and Leanne Welham clearly worked together to make this season look consistent throughout every episode, but I still believe the pacing needs better control (if last season was a tad slow, the second one might be a bit rushed).All in all, His Dark Materials returns with a much more captivating and entertaining second season. Boasting impressive visuals, wonderful cinematography, and an exceptional score, Dafne Keen and Amir Wilson carry the main narrative through non-stop, surprisingly vicious action and shocking story developments as the charming protagonists, Lyra and Will, respectively. Their relationship is steadily and cleverly developed, also working as a STOP sign to the occasionally rushed pacing. Ruth Wilson continues to deliver the most outstanding performance of all, but Dr. Mary Malone steals the spotlight, becoming one of the most interesting characters in the show due to her crucial storyline, which delivers some jaw-dropping revelations. Except for a subplot involving the witches and the Magisterium, every episode moves surprisingly well through impactful narrative decisions and eventful sequences. Hugely acclaimed actors like James McAvoy, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Andrew Scott rarely show up during these first five episodes (or don't show up at all), but the last two still share an exciting story that could have a major impact on the season's final two chapters. A final praise to the production's (brilliant) decisions of adding four more writers besides Jack Thorne, and choosing only two directors to command the entire season. If season one didn't fully convince you, season two will most definitely do the job.Final Thoughts
(based on the remaining episodes and the entire season)The remaining two episodes are nothing short of shocking. His Dark Materials ends its second season with narrative and character decisions that will definitely generate divisive opinions. No one knew about the series ending on its third season at the time of viewing, so I reacted to certain choices heavily questioning the real reasons behind them since most felt extremely rushed, out of nowhere, and surprisingly underwhelming. Now, knowing that there's only one more season, I'm struggling between considering the season finale disappointing or reasonably decent, having in mind the series status.It's a shame that such compelling world-building has to end so soon. This series could easily create new stories to last years. Possessing a talented cast and gorgeous visuals, it could really become one of HBO's biggest shows. However, looking at it now, casting James McAvoy, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and even Andrew Scott was nothing more than a marketing scheme to get more viewers. Entering a third and final season, barely being able to see these actors, mainly McAvoy, is a profound letdown, and the latest episodes don't solve the issue.It's still a step-up from the debut season, and the standalone episode starring Lord Asriel that the global pandemic ""stole"" would surely improve the missing pieces of storytelling. So, taking everything into account, I still feel quite satisfied with how Jack Thorne and his fellow co-writers connected the several storylines. Let us all hope for an outstanding ending!Rating: B+",7/10
18 December 2021,"For the last 7 weeks, His Dark Materials second season has been on BBC One and now it has finished so here is my review. The premise of the season sees Lyra and Will come together to attempt to find an object to protect them both from evil forces.Main Character
Dafne Keen is back as Lyra and once again she is really good in the role. It is just really easy to root for her and want to see her succeed in her quest and I also think she has matured in the role and showing stronger acting ability. Amir Wilson plays Will and I must admit I didn't warm to him at first, whether that was the first season or this season but he bought me around. I really liked the dynamic between Lyra and Will as the season progressed and I actually believed they had a friendship and that it had been developed throughout the season.Supporting Characters
Ruth Wilson plays Mrs Coulter and again she is really good here, her character is well developed and unlike the first season I actually believed she cared about Lyra and despite her own personal goals that plays much heavier in this season which is a nice development here. Lin Manuel Miranda and Andrew Scott are the team-up we never knew we needed, for me they are the most entertaining part of the show and really do a great job in adding some fun tot this show while keeping with the depth. However, the rest of the cast didn't work for me, Simone Kirby's character annoyed the hell out of me, mainly because the part of the plot she was involved in and how it just takes away from the mystique that the show has built up. All the stuff to do with the witches and magisterium starts off alright but falls flat and flatters to deceive and feels like a waste of time.Story
The story had me pretty much shaking my head throughout and felt like a weaker element then in the previous season. Yes the relationships between Lyra and Will is well handled and Lin Manuel Miranda and Andrew Scott are a fun pairing but the way they finished these characters arcs this season really disappointed me. So much that it has me questioning whether I even want to bother with the next season. I would say there is more going on this season that isn't connected to Lyra and it just isn't particularly interesting and it makes some of the mistakes of last season while creating whole new ones.Script
The show does have some well written scenes in it for sure mainly between the main characters and that does a good job in making them pretty likeable and well done. But this show suffers from weak circumstantial writing, every show is guilty of it but I thought this show suffered with it more and it bogged down the show for me and made it harder for me to get on board.Style
The one thing this show has for it is that it looks fantastic, the world looks great and that continues this season as visually the show does stand out from others. Due to the pandemic this show had 7 episodes instead of 8 and there is not much they could have done about that but to me it did feel like there was parts of the show that was missing and underdeveloped which is a shame considering the world that is built through the two seasons.Overall
Overall, the second season is a step down in quality and only represents an average show. I think if you weren't convinced by the first season then this won't do much more for you and if they continue like this I do worry for this shows future.Rating - 5/10.",5/10
2 January 2020,"I never read the books and I was not a big fan of the previous Golden Compass movie. This show expands on the novels. It features this girl who has a golden compass of truth and also an animal ally. There are beings of dark magic who kidnap children, cities in the sky, and eventually some polar bear warriors. Each episode has very high quality filmmaking, and good scripts. This show also has a great opening score. My problem is the show is very slow, the acting all the same dull dark tone, and Lin-Manuel Miranda is a horrible actor and poorly cast.",7/10
13 February 2020,"""His Dark Materials"" (S01, 10 eps, 1hr, HBO) is a decent enough fantasy with good production values but it's for the young crowd. This series is NOT for YA/adults, in fact, the target demo is tween/YT, and particularly femmes in that group. The cute, talking animals will really be a treat for them. I tried to give it a chance but it's simply not designed for me and that's why I have to rate it a ""2"", however I'm certain the target demo will legitimately rate it 8/9/10 which is fine, we all have to rate from our own perspective.",2/10
22 December 2019,Well I watched the Golden Compass which was ok not as good as I was hoping even with Daniel Craig's and Nicole Kidman . I was hoping that the TVs series would have been improved but to be honest Apart from some minor details there is no difference must say I think Ruth Wilson plays a mean baddy never forget her in Luther she was great. However as far as his dark materials is concerned I found it slow and no improvement on the film version. Wether the follow up books in this series are better remains to be seen? As another reviewer stated this is no Harry Potter and I agree totally if compared it would be no closer than a 50th cousin removed!,4/10
24 December 2019,"It seems people who read the books, can follow this better, but it is not true to the books. it often is hard to script good complex books. but someone who knows said, they add new material instead of following the books.
I can't criticize the acting, characters or plots- because somehow it blurs together. while those who read the books, dislike this, at least it makes sense to them.
people's spirit become physical animal, so horses and things run around and children seem to have talking ferrets- luckily they don't eat and do other natural things. but a boat load of men, where are their bulky animals?
and than there's a sub-group of natives whose children are stolen.
and dust creates light particles which reveal other worlds- or something like that-
the grandiose music to make it seem epic annoys me. and gets really load too.
Ruth Wilson's ""posh"" accent annoys me.
HBO has so many losers, BBC or not- here Fantasy, Catherine the Great, Historic, Succession modern greed, Mrs. Fletcher social satire, and Baller sports comedy(?).",2/10
11 November 2019,"Firstly I'll start with the redeeming, it is beautifully directed, the cinematography is excellent as is the vfx. However as usual for the BBC and the awful Bad Wolf production company who make the shamelessly bad Doctor Who they destroy the book quickly by making it so sickly PC that it induces vomit. Characters are changed to such a degree that people who have read the books just laugh out loud, (that's the Golden Compass perhaps it should be called the Golden iPad ffs) etc, if these books can sell millions with the characters as are, why do these companies feel the need to change them? Then the fact that the second episode jumps timeline so greatly you really understand the opening sequence where it says 'BASED ON'.
Finally the other redeeming quality is Dafne Keen, she has a great future following on from her performance in Logan.",4/10
31 July 2020,"So far, His Dark Materials is doing a great job with adapting the novel Northern Lights. What I love most about His Dark Materials is the quality. The set design and filming locations are just as well produced as big budget Hollywood movies. The special and visual effects are really impressive, it's so good that it actually won an award for best special, visual & graphic effects. The acting is also very impressive, because child actors are either a hit or miss, and fortunately it was a hit. The pacing was really well executed too; it does take a little long to get to the fun bits, but not too slow that it'll bore you.The only issue I have with His Dark Materials is the exposition. I think that there's a fair amount of exposition given for the storytelling that's not overbearing. The only issue with the exposition was the lack of detail given for Carlo Boreal's story. He's frequently traveling between a world where there are no daemons. And at first it looks like he's teleporting within the same world, but later it makes it more obvious that he's not. Because of that, some episodes become jarring or feel out of place.Overall, His Dark Materials is a great TV series that's interesting to watch. You get movie quality acting, CGI, and set design. The storytelling is great too, but the lack of exposition for Carlo Boreal's story makes some episodes quite jarring. I also like how well they set up everything for season two, and so far I can't wait. His Dark Materials is absolutely worth a watch.",8/10
5 November 2019,"I've seen people her complaining about the pronunciation of the word ""Daemon"". It is in fact pronounced demon. If you've imagined that differently reading the book, that's not the shows fault.",
28 December 2019,"Pullman fans should be fine with this adaptation of his monumental fantasy epic, and newbies, hopefully, won't get confused and wander off. The specifics of his contrarian cosmography are explained pretty painlessly, without too much expository dialogue, and the CGI embodiments of the daemons and bears and other particulars of PP's steampunk world are easily as convincing as they need to be, at least as far as this credulous adult's concerned.I still miss Nicole Kidman's drop-dead gorgeousness and Jim Carter's natty dreadlocks from the film of The Golden Compass, and some might argue that Daniel Craig seems more like a heaven-storming rebel than James McAvoy, but Lord Asriel's also a geeky cosmologist, so that's all right then. It may be noteworthy that the film cast Sam Elliott, who played the cowboy narrator in Lebowski, as the balloonist Lee Scoresby, which is fine but a bit on the nose. It's also fine that this time he's played by Lin-Manuel Miranda, because who among us can say what a ""New Dane from Texas"" with a jackrabbit sidekick would look and talk like?To their credit, the showrunners of the series aren't as hinky as the producers of the film seem to have been about portraying the baddies, the Magisterium, as agents of a malignant outgrowth of orthodox Christianity (that took shape, you may recall, on the election of Pope John Calvin--so good and evil, but mostly evil, accd'g to Pullman, on both sides).A fair amount of material from Book Two is folded into the first season, which should set us up for Will and Lyra's fateful meeting at the beginning of season two. While rereading Book One, I came across a couple of ingenious plot points that had fallen by the wayside--e.g., one of the scams that Lyra works on the bear-king to keep him from lighting up her beloved Iorek Byrnison--but that kind of shrinkage seems inevitable with a project of this scope. I'm left wondering how some of the more abstruse stretches of Book Two or Three could be brought to the small screen when PP's metaphysical objectives drift away from the straight-ahead fantasy-quest plotline of The Golden Compass, but so far it's all good.",9/10

21 March 2021,"I'm not a big fan of fantasy stuff so I admit I at first rushed to brush this series aside as utterly dull hogwash, but then the more I understood, the more I loved it. I absolutely love the idea of the multiverse and crossing between multiple worlds in any show or movie, and ""The Man in the High Castle"" remains my all-time sci-fi TV favorite. Season 2 is much better, by the way, as the wild-eyed, dreamy, unassuming 12-year-old Lyra becomes mature, cynical, cheeky and an absolutely hardy badass alongside the equally brave but often self-critical Will Parry. Can't wait for season 3 and definitely gonna read the books!",10/10
15 December 2020,"Season 1 was OK, and liked it most of time. Although, I think that it started with loosing spirit, ideas near to end. And yes. there is season 2, and I just don't like it anymore.",5/10
7 February 2021,"I get the feeling that reading the books would be more entertaining. I feel the protagonist Lyra to be flat except when mournful I've seen more emotion from Spock in the original Star Trek.
The other characters are hyperbolic in their acting (then again souls placed in animals that talk- or are a vocalization of the subconscious, though when coming of age it's clear from the external soul whether it influences the person or how grounded the person is in materialism and uses their spirit animal to do harm). Find it interesting that female characters have daemons (not Demons) that have male vocals and that males have female vocals (which is quite rooted in many theologies).Dust/Dark Matter/The Human Soul
With the influx of Science Fiction which is accurately or inaccurately based on Theoretical Physics (emphasis on theoretical).
I see no contradiction in religion and science just terminology by science and hubris. In fact this show is a primary example, and I'm not a Christian or Muslim but do believe in Monotheism a creator beyond human conception because the creator has no beginning or end, and is infinite beyond time and space.
A theoretical physicist would refer to this concept in terms of invisible dark matter and invisible dark energy, (all hypothetical and only made sensible with mathematical formulations and computer imagery). Actually without demonstrating their theories with math and CGI they would sound like lunatics).
That point aside their are parallels in this show to the Catholic Church historically. Historically the Church to hypothetical outside observers, is a self proclaimed holy gateway between this world and the next. They have declared ""Holy Wars"", massacred Jews, have manipulated monarchies until WWI with ""The Divine Right of Kings"", and have been fiscally corrupt. That's not heresy that's historical objective fact.
They condemned Galileo and men of science based on misguided conceptions of heresy....
So if the ""Magesterium"" is a parallel to the church historically it is. It's male dominated, open witch hunts, historical doctrines that any contradicting thought or philosophy be it sound in mind or lunacy threatens its control. Obviously today the Church is not what it was 300 or even 100 years ago. Not in its open influence or political power perhaps under the table with money but I'm not digressing into conspiracies.... Christian critics of the show I find are delusional. I don't see the show encouraging witch-craft either. The show however only focuses on the negative aspects of an institution and not some of its positive ones. The story also fails to differentiate between a higher power and the institution.
If you're a parent and have questions about some of these concepts their is a site physics.org that does its best to explain both concrete and theoretical physics in laymen's terms. I have not found anything that makes science any more absolute than monotheism they both rest on certain principles that require faith that those beliefs and principles are factual. If one sees them as factual you can punch wholes through math and science as much as religion or belief.
Personally I feel they compliment one another and give one an appreciation for life.
I feel the story is trying not to do that, but inadvertently does if you separate the institution from the ""source"".
Overall these aren't concepts that are novel in entertainment it has exaggerated liberal undertones like everything else and that's the artists prerogative.
It's not mindless entertainment but I wouldn't call it Soprano Entertainment hence a 6.",6/10

6 November 2019,"I liked dark compass and this has all the elements to impress, but I wasnt..Maybe i'm among the minority, but the story didnt grab my attention, nor did the actors..I actually was clicking around doing other things while part of it was on...Not a good sign..Cinematography beautiful,not stunning but very nice..Something that probably contributed to my lack of attention or interest was the heavy and varied accents of the actors and how so few of them speak clearly with annunciation...They tend to mumble their words and That ,at least for me made it really hard to follow what was being said...Give me people who can speak with clarity,and without heavy accents, the british speaking dialect has been done to death and these are not Brits who speak with clear annunciation, these are Brits who mumble and slurr their words...Anyway, that killed alot of the enjoyment for me, That and the story just didnt hold or grab my attention and the lead young actress is just mehh... As with all new series, its the 1st episode and things need time to evolve, thats why I gave a 7..there is much here to create a great story and the effects budget is large, things look good, so we will see..

I really liked the books when I read them years ago and remember being fairly excited when ""The Golden Compass"" movie was announced. That movie pretty much flailed and failed and ended the would-be movie trilogy/franchise prematurely.I had hoped against hope that the series, having more freedom to operate, content and time wise, would do a much better job. It didn't. It was a sloppy, boring mess. An uninspired cast, led by Dafne Keen who is let's say not everyone's cup of tea, to put it mildly, was further let down by mediocre writing and middling special effects. If this is a BBC/HBO co-production...it surely doesn't feel or look that way.I only barely made it through the first season.

10 December 2019,"Harry Potter is so 2 decades ago & Those comparing and complaining need to get a grip. ""His Dark Materials"" is not a carbon copy by any means even though fantasy genres may have similarities. But comparing a movie to TV series will lead you down the path of apple's and oranges especially when you consider ""His Dark Materials"" deals with a much more mature themed narrative and storyline. ""His Dark Materials"" is about a powerful and wealthy religious based cult organization that's abducting or kidnapping kids for a mysteriously cynical reason. It's also very apparent that Harry Potter which mostly takes place at a magical school for witches and warlocks, ""His Dark Materials"" will not only span across countries and continents it will delve into different dimensions and parallel universes. For fantasy lovers this will be a much needed new addition to the genre as Dafne Keen is sensational while guided by many amazing veteran actors like Ruth Wilson, Lin-Manuel, James Cosmo, Clarke Peter's and oh yeh James McAvoy to name a few. Don't feed into the hate for comparisons sake, This show will carve out a spot in TV history all on it's own without any help from Dumbledore trust me.",9/10
23 December 2020,"His Dark Materials makes for a fun fantasy series, but it has convinced me I don't really care to read the source material. I have no doubt it's a bit more nuanced, philosophical and deep, but the recipe is so very tiresome: a girl is special. She is Chosen! There are prophecies! She can use the mcguffin that others need years of training to learn instantaneously! A bunch of people (seriously, a HORDE of them) are ready to fight and die for her after meeting her for about 4 minutes and she tells them that...umm...well, nothing important really, but they're sold. Worse, there is also a special boy, equally special. Daddy issues! Very mature. Comes with his own magic mcguffin (most important and unique item in all the universe(s), say people who have visited maybe one or two of apparently countless worlds).This isn't meant to be an offense to the fans or the story, which does have its merits in the show format, and probably has more as a book. But I've come to be allergic to messianic figures and ""chosen ones"" in fantasy (to be fair the story may predate their flooding of the genre) - if you must use them, I say go the Robert Jordan way and make them larger than life.",7/10

There is magic and steampunked technology and many layers of villans and hapless heroes.

27 November 2019,"I was so excited to watch this show because I watched the Golden Compass movie and felt that the time was too restricted for the story the movie was undertaking. The casting is amazing and the actors all play their roles immaculately. Ruth Wilson, James McAvoy, and Lin Manuel Miranda are clear standouts. The show has so many interesting characters that it is hard to give all of them ample screen time.Dafne Keen shines as Lyra Belacqua. She was amazing in the movie Logan and she is dazzling in this role as well. She easily displays complex emotions and acts very, very well for someone her age. Her character forges relationships with others very easily and Keen has great chemistry with her costars.His Dark Materials is very, very similar to Harry Potter. Harry Potter expands on mythology just like His Dark Materials. There are witches, talking polar bears, alternate worlds that are discussed within the first few episodes alone. Not to mention, the inclusion of daemons (souls in animal form) is absolutely fascinating and riveting in the show.The writing of Phillip Pullman is magical and I am so excited to see what will happen next and what changes might be made. I highly, highly suggest this show!!!",8/10

All to save children and learn about ""Dust""...which has sinful implications.Whilst this first series only deals with Northern Lights, there is a lot to enjoy and be hopeful for as they commence to go though the remaining two books in Philip Pullmans work!It is a blessing that they have kept it simple, just covering one book per series, and not overcomplicating the delivery of the story. The purists won't like that they have moved away from the linear narrative that they usually read in the book. However by introducing Will Parry earlier on does make elements of the Subtle Knife and some of the directions that story takes much easier to follow.Feels slightly rushed at times, but very enjoyable, hugely entertaining and brilliantly produced. I'm very much looking forward to season 2 when that is released!",9/10
30 December 2020,"The primary flaw of this show is the same as GoT, in truth: a female character that somehow wields power without logic or reason behind it. And we are not talking about Lyra here. In truth, Dafne Keen is one of the only reasons to watch this series. She's excellent. Lin-Manuel Miranda is wasted doing his worst David Schwimmer impersonation. The first season of the show is a good exploration and exposition of the premise, but the second season is too convoluted and ridiculous to stomach seriously. At what point can we no longer suspend our disbelief enough to enjoy fantasy fiction? When characters do stupid things without logic or reason ... yes, real people have those flaws, too, but with narrative storytelling, it becomes blatant plot contrivance. And that's bad. This brings us full circle back to the primary flaw: the Coulter character is like Cersei Lannister ... no one in these fictional settings would tolerate either person in realistic scenarios. That makes too much of the plot laughable. Stick around for the third season, just for Ms. Keen's brilliance, but ... suffer the rest at your own risk.",7/10

12 November 2019,"I have never read the books (Phillip Pullman's trilogy by the same name, His Dark Materials) and therefore knew nothing about the story or the world in which it is staged.Because of that, the 1st episode was a bit too much. Too many concepts were thrown around - Gobblers, Dust, Daemon, and other weird words while explaining the new aforementioned concepts. That and the concept of multiple words made it a) harder to follow and b) too obvious you were watching a first episode where you need to be introduced to everything.
It was not a particularly smooth experience of immersion into this world.But the 2nd episode really kicked it up a notch - they spend less time explaining every detail of this fantasy world and actually let the viewer figure out some things on his/her own. And, more importantly, they build a narrative. A narrative that should make most people interested in watching the 3rd one! Which is what this is all about.I think visually the show looks fine, but could perhaps be even more ambitious - if every single person has a Daemon, shouldn't there be an absolute chaos of animals all around in every scene where there are multiple people? Seems only the characters we follow actually have their animal-selves...Where the show really pulls off something different is that the story is often so immersive, that you forget that is actually supposed to happen in the present - despite being in an alternative world - so they travel in zeppelins but at the same time, they resort to smartphones. It is quite challenging to keep balance on this point, and His Dark Materials succeedsCasting seems to be top notch, although one would expect as much from a HBO-BBC tandem.
Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel seem spot on, although not fully convinced by Dafne Keen's Lyra... Came across initially like a 2019 version of Matilda (1996) and I would've thought it should be a much more complex character than that. But obviously there's many episodes to go, so it's early to tell.Definitely worth watching, even if you know nothing about the books it is based on!",

Again, those who've read the books may be able to follow as they will already know the story and it's fantastical twists, but I haven't and can't. Two episodes has been more than enough wasted time.For me, this is a children's story and what it's doing on at peak time on Sundays escapes me.

It's a different form of entertainment there's bound to be some liberties taken. Anyways here's whats good:The production value is great. I like the atmosphere ,setting, and some things look exactly how I pictured them in my head. The acting for the most part is good, not great, but its fine minus lee. Unfortunately that's about all there is good in the show.What I don't like:The story is rushed: It literally jumps from one major plot point to the next within a few episodes with almost nothing in between. One of the few times where I feel they should've taken some liberties with the storytelling.Character development: There almost is none. Characters simply show up and are instantly best friends. For example, lee claiming to ""love"" lyra (in a protective type way) just doesn't land at all, serafina randomly showing up to help, declaring the fate of the world is in peoples hands, ugh just rushed and weird. They've barely had any interaction with her onscreen for the viewers to believe they've developed a strong relationship. I do the like the actress they chose for Lyra but I do agree with other reviews here that they did not flesh out her personality enough at all. She's far to tame and almost boring in the show.Miscasts: I feel lee scoresby is biggest miscast in recent memory. He can't act plain and simple. He has this weird southern but not southern accent and doesn't pull off the ""likable troublemaker with a heart"" type character at all. Should've gotten someone older for Lord Asriel. I barely buy McAvoy in the role. Farder corum seems far to emotional in the show imo. I find most of the demons voices strange and off putting especially lee's demon.All that being said I still don't consider this a bad show. If it continues at this pace with rushed storytelling and bad character development into S2 then I'll just write this off as another failed adaptation and hope someone gets it right in the future. Listen to the audiobooks they are the best ""live action"" version so far.",6/10
10 December 2019,"Having been let down by HBO's disregard for the Watchmen comics, I was wary of engaging with another beloved print-to-film adaptation for fear of disappointment. Thankfully, nothing could be further from the truth.Where HBO's American interpretation of a British source material is lost in translation, a fate that befell the first attempt to Bring His Dark Materials to screen, resulting in an uncertain future for the project.Here we have a British interpretation of a British source material, and the result is that the adaptation literarlly recreates the books for the screen. A triumph of film-making, and although the series still has some way to go, the producers have respected the original source material and respected the artist that created it. A beautiful empathetic production with absolutely superb set-design.",8/10
14 November 2019,"This series has run the incredible books through a 'woke' filter.Add in some serious timing issues, and a hunger games style over reliance on long shots of middling actor's faces and you have a recipe for an irritating slog.I'm giving it another couple of episodes and if it doesn't improve it will be yet another series dropped through ideological corruption and bad storytelling.10 stars, because the source material is epic. 4 stars off for sinsedit.

16 April 2020,"I felt such great anticipation for this series! And now I feel especially let down. This series is not bad by any means. Unfortunately nor does it excite the viewer with the amount of amazement and wonder this series is capable of delivering.Another review I passed had mentioned, that in making this, the creator focused on readers of the series rather than the general audience. I find that to be very untrue and infact quite contrary. Yes there is a fantastic joining of events happening between book 1 & 2 which provides great insight in a ""meanwhile"" sense, to fill in the audience. Although there are plenty of examples of poorly executed scenes that are to the delight of viewers exclusively. Each of the highly anticipated action sequences ended up being less than dramatic and rushed pieces that would leave a viewer wanting to read the book to know more. I was expecting a detailed spectacle of dramatic combat, at least twice, and instead was left with a cheaply served bottle battle scene and a nondescript camera covered CGI fight. Given the nature of one of the fights I expected it to be CGI but could not anticipate that the majority of the camera would be covered at the conclusion. Leaving what is supposed to be a powerful and game-changing scene to instead be an off-camera finish that's left for the imagination.At first viewing I had appreciated the level of detail presented in a couple episodes. I was willing to push aside my initial concern about the pace, because I was glad to see the emphasis on detail related to the original story; along with additives to provide a better viewing experience for TV. Now that I have seen how the time they made up for, in being a TV series, was used to over explain some details while letting important well written details fall away from the series, I am not willing to forgive the slow pace and tone. If you give the time a lot of padding to explain the world then don't neglect to include the provided details, at crucial parts of the story, that deserve to be presented in graphic dramatic imagery. To be perfectly clear, I'm not saying there were portions completely cut that I would have wanted as a reader; rather that things which remained in were given so little detail on screen that a viewer would be left wondering what just happened.I would have to conclude by saying that in some ways the original movie may have been better. The best plus I can give to this series is that it looks visually stunning. I had only hoped that more emphasis would have be paid to some of the most memorable portions of the story.",8/10
12 December 2019,"I was really looking forward to this having read the books many years ago and being disappointed in the film version, I was hopeful the the BBC would work its magic and deliver a worthy series. We are now up to episode 6 and I am still waiting for things to take off. Unfortunately there seems to be a flatness to the production despite its stellar cast and, apparently, tons of money being thrown into it. I am sure Dafne Keen is a good actress but has so far been unable to capture the unique and vibrant character of Lyra, and although the film version totally missed the mark I feel Dakota Blue Richards portrayal was much better. Overall the TV series lacks 'oomph', there is something missing, something in the essence of the story that is not present.
I wonder if His Dark Materials is just one of those books that defies a screen translation.17/12 update: I wanted to add two things; yes I agree there is a lack of focus on the important relationship between person and daemon, with daemons being represented as pets rather than core to one's being. The second thing was there was a lovely glimpse of this relationship when Lee and Hester make their first appearance and are singing together, which I thought was beautiful.",3/10

13 May 2020,"I really liked golden compass movie. the story was good and the actors were great in that movie.so i waited for this show with great anticipation.... but the result is a big disappointment.what happened to serial shows / tv series? it seems there was a golden era around lost/fringe (2006-2010) and after that everything's gone downhill. even if there comes a real gem once in a while, it gets cancelled or finishes too early (flashforward, forever, legion etc). most series nowadays have very boring and loooong stroy telling which can be finished in 1 or 2 epidoses but instead streches to 15-20 and have seriously annoying and bad characters.we see the same pattern here, the story can be told in maximum 2 episodes and the casting shouldn't be anymore horrible (couldn't stand ruth wilson's character and to be honest wilson herself as she is unbelieveably antipathetic). no chemistry, no believability. just dry, boring & antipathetic acting. so this makes all the episodes dull & boring.even james mcavoy couldn't save this mess, i feel sorry for him..",2/10

19 December 2019,"I wish I've never seen the Golden Compass (GC) movie before, but I did, so I could not escape comparing at least the main characters: Lord Ashriel, Miss Coulter and Lyra. In GC movie they're just perfect: enigmatic, charismatic characters with their strengths and faults.This series' Lord Ashriel looked more like a wimpy overgrown kid. McAvoy, despite his excellent over-acting, never got to me as a strong person as Mr James Bond (Daniel Craig), as well as the dangerous and cunning yet lavishly pretty Miss Coulter which was perfectly portrayed by another A-class actress: Nicole Kidman. This series' Miss Coulter is pretty-- ugly; her forward, elongated lips remind me of a duck or platypus' beak.Then of course Lyra; I loved much the vibrant, brilliant, brave, mischievious kid Lyra in the Golden Compass, which was severely lacking in the series. You can even get the vibe right off the bat at the way she's talking or make a little gestures; this dumb annoying Lyra is the worst between the three main casts.Lastly, as have been noticed by others, the daemons. Everybody should have had their own daemon! That's why they abducted those kids in the first place, to experimenting people by cutting their daemon.Edit: I rate it 6/10.

Even Dafne Keen, brilliant in Logan, is reduced to forcing out an ""ain't"" which sounds so misplaced, so wrong, against her well-spoken acting voice.Clarke Peters is straining so hard to do an English accent that he sounds like his jaw has been wired shut. Why bother? I'm not sure it would have mattered that much if he'd just been American.There really is some dreadful acting, but from actors who are capable of so much more. I can only put this down to the quite jarring, expositional dialogue (really, really eye-roll inducing and terribly difficult to listen to.... ""is this airship like the one my parents died in?"" etc etc), but James McAvoy in particular is abysmal and seems capable of one tone, one facial expression.",5/10

People need to do a little research and quit being lazy before spouting off about something they know nothing about obviously.I've seen other series get the same treatment because people don't read or do research. So annoying. Anyway the show is great. Yes, the movie only got the tip of the iceberg. The show actually goes deeper into the relationships of characters and their backgrounds. The acting is good. The actors are fantastic. And it is British because it's supposed to be.Give it three episodes before you throw it away due to crappy reviews giving this show the shaft.",
4 November 2019,"I've read all the books and seen The Golden Compass quite a few times, but this definitely surpasses the film. The young actress playing Lyra was so good - absolutely perfect for the part. The actress playing Mrs Coulter was far better than Nicole Kidman's Mrs Coulter. James McAvoy was well cast too. I am looking forward to the other episodes and hope that they can keep up the high standard set by this first one. Incidentally my son who is not a reader, after seeing the film said it was the first time he felt like reading the books. The animation of the daemons was well done.

Take heart, dear non-readers and remember: Many, many many more people on this planet have NOT read the books than have. That said, I too, found much of this series confusing, right from the start. The key to adapting a dense fantasy series, is editing. Distilling the novels to a streamlined script fit for this medium. As other non-readers have pointed out, there's way too much exposition and minutiae tossed in, all over. As if we should know it all beforehand. The story itself, acting and FX are terrific otherwise. But do yourself a favor non-readers, and skip the series.",2/10
10 November 2019,"There's no doubt that the production is superb - visually, it's spectacular - but, for me, this adaptation suffers from odd casting choices, and misses some key character traits, making them seem a bit flat.
I should say, that I'm reviewing this having read the books. Maybe if I hadn't and had no expectations I would have enjoyed it more. Instead, I watched it trying to suppress my disappointment.
In the book, Mrs Coulter (Ruth Wilson), is charming, elegant, charismatic, the centre of attention before whom everyone stands in awe or trembles with fear. But in the first episode she is invisible and rather dull.
The makers have the perfect actor for John Faa in the form of James Cosmo, but have cast him in a different role. Ma Costa should be an authoritative matriarch, but she isn't. James McAvoy seems too youthful and lacking in commanding presence to be Lord Azriel.
Lyra is missing a key part of her personality. In the book, she is a compulsive liar - it's what defines her and is almost her super power making her a gifted story teller. It's a key element in the story, but it's entirely missing, so far.
If you haven't read the books, I suspect it will be an enjoyable and watchable series, but for readers and fans, I think it's just going to be distractingly irritating.",6/10

The story is fascinating and it unfolds slowly and beautifully. The girl that plays Lyra is a terrific young actress - one to watch. The 3D animation of the daemons is some of the best 3D I have seen, especially Pan, who's character seems as well developed as Lyra's. There's a seen on a boat where Lyra is lamenting coming of age because Pan will no longer be able to shape-shift, he will have to choose only one animal to be for the rest of their lives.

2 February 2021,"'His Dark Materials' represents a dramatic production which is situated within the confines of an envelope of considerable religious controversy. Such that, for those whose attentions are drawn to this entertainment genre, or the related writing and dramatic productions which embodied this storyline, publication via the big screen has been poorly rewarded and regarded, overall. Specifically, the author of the originating books, Philip Pullman, positions his unique, and otherwise popular storyline, re-envisaging Christian theological concepts. Although, most likely, this was never explicitly intended as direct theological rebuttal, it is, apparently, theologically disruptive. Situationally, it seems to me, this creative tension is more art driven than intentional philosophical critique. Even so, considerable furor ensued with the publication of the original movie.According to the storyline, across a multi-verse of worlds or dimensions, people live lives; whereby, their soul expresses in different forms. Consequently, in some instances, human souls are expressed as interactive, living, companion animal totems. Furthermore, and this is likely the most contested aspect of the storyline, at least for me, god's kingdom - heaven, is represented as a celestial space of intense political contention. Thus, within this heavenly sphere, factions of godly forces are engaged in a tense and on-going battle for the control of heaven. It seems Philip Pullman does not see the divine sphere as situated outside human failing and material ambition but entirely subject to human weaknesses.Sadly, while I have read all the books which underpin the subsequent movie and television productions, and found the movie and the latter released multi-series television production highly engaging, I struggle with the latter third of the storyline and its premise. Personally, I am not troubled by the theologically creative speculation involved in the story's narrative. Yet, the premise of this tale, to my mind, becomes confused and farcical in its attempts to resolve the storyline. However, I realise this is more a strong representation of my own spirituality than a reasonable criticism of Pullman's narrative.Battling armies who fight for the dominion and control of heaven because of its inherent unjust and unkind pastoral tenets towards the human and other races does not carry much believability, for me. Understandably, there are many who may, quite likely, hold a contrary perspective. In point of fact, however, and in reality, Pullman's concept, of heavenly conflict, does actually follow aspects of some core biblical tenets: the insurrection and contention leading to the heavenly disavowal of Lucifer and his incarceration in hell.Overall, from my perspective, this aspect of Philip Pullman's otherwise brilliant creative form, falls flat and heavily disappoints, for me, as I interpret it. Thereby, I await to see how this latest production will grapple with, what I perceive to be, a problematic creative conundrum. Internally, we are asked to believe, it seems, the ethnocentricity of human culture flows through into the Divine realm. Dependent upon individual spiritual grounding this may or may not present a challenge.",8/10

4 November 2020,"First of all, I've read all three books (like many others here). Saw 'The Golden Compass,' which I thought a failure. Then saw this. A bit of a failure also.
Lets start with Lyra. Her character, in the book, is defiant, a tomboy and self-reliant. None of that here. Here, she's a whimpering, frightened child for at least a few episodes (that's all I saw, so if she's changed, well, that can only be good).
Mrs. Coulter? Now, HER I like more than Nicole Kidman. She has more depth of expression (Nicole was sociopathic and charming; this woman is just tough and has good manners rather than actual charm). Sets are nice.
The main characters are not as good actors as the supporting cast itself. It's enjoyable if you haven't been watching movies for 60 years, but isn't it odd how every single person speaks 20th Century English??? No matter what movie, what world it takes place it, if you close your eyes, they all sound like they're from the 20th century. So, apparently, not first-rate writers.
But knock yourself out. Give it a 10 if you want! For me, a ""10"" would mean good acting, stylish, clever, WELL-WRITTEN AND DIRECTED, and, last of all... CONVINCING. This is none of those unless you are, forgive me, unsophisticated in your viewing habits. However, it's COVID times, and I know the story, so I'm watching it - for 20 minutes - followed by an hour of something I REALLY like - and then another 20 minutes of this. The time passes faster when I look at it like that!
And neither it NOR 'The Golden Compass' come close to being magical, any more than 'The Chronicles of Narnia' was magical. But, enjoy yourselves. I'd suggest lots of popcorn: mediocre movies are more enjoyable with popcorn!",3/10

Normally this irritates me when this is done but I appreciate it's probably following the books and there's clearly a lot to tell here so I mind it less.What I would say is the second season is going to need to deliver. There has been a lot of time dedicated to scene/context setting and character building, which at times made the show seem very slow. That's fine if what follows delivers...having done all of this I'd expect the second season to be a lot more exciting and have a real pace to it. There are a lot of comparisons to Game of Thrones in the reviews here, and one thing they were not afraid of (final season aside) was taking their time to set the scene for a story allowing them to build to epic crescendos.I enjoyed it.

10 December 2019,"6 episodes in, and I can't believe the quality of what we've gotten so far. The visuals are amazing and the CG for all the animals (daemons) is absolutely stunning. The Acting is extremely solid and much better than I was expecting, with Dafne Keene, Lin Manuel-Miranda and Ruth Wilson being the most impressive. The worldbuilding they're doing and mystery they're creating with every episode is also astonishing and I cant wait for the next episode!Another major bonus is the F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C score of the show and the voice acting for Iorek Byrnison that gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. Only negative that comes to mind is the pacing that sometimes feels a little off. The first few episodes are a bit slow, and some parts of the story fly by too quickly, but in the end, it doesn't bother me.",8/10
8 November 2021,"I love the world it is trying to portray, but after a few episodes you almost start to think that daemons are something exclusive for the main characters. In large rooms with many people no Daemon is in sight, only some birds near the ceiling so they didn't have to combine the human shots with the animals. This is in my opinion a major flaw in the show, since the daemons/animals are what makes the world unique. The story itself is good and the acting choices are great, but it is a bit slow, so it doesn't draw me in and keeps me entertained.",5/10

In no way does it feel like made for TV - with one exception. The ""film makers"" seem to be in love, misguidedly, with a) British actors (I'm British myself) and b) especially Amir Wilson. He's terrible throughout season 2, and the one thing that reminds you this is TV and not film quality. Resulting in a 9 rating, not 10. Otherwise, sublime and extraordinary.",9/10
8 November 2021,"His Dark Materials is the BBC and HBO's adaptation of Philip Pullman's fantasy novel series of the same name which previously received a big screen adaptation in the form of the 2007 movie The Golden Compass which due to studio meddling and protest from religious groups never got a sequel.As someone who never read the books I enjoyed the 2007 movie despite it's flaws and so decided to watch this series to see if they got it right this time. Overall I think the series is better than the movie due to the fact it's format allows it to expand on the story and include elements that had to be cut for the big screen adaptation. That being said there are also some elements of the movie that I prefer.The first three episodes are a bit slow and introduce a lot of terminology and concepts that aren't really explained until later but if you can manage to get through them, the rest of the episodes are worth it. Unlike the movie, the ending remains intact and they keep many of the darker elements of the story.The cast give great performances with Dafne Keen, following her breakout role in Logan doing a good job as protagonist Lyra. Ruth Wilson is also amazing as Mrs. Coulter, she pulls off being both kind and caring as well as scary and intimidating in the scenes which require it. Generally I think I prefer the cast from the movie and feel they fit their characters better (Sam Elliott can't be beaten as Lee Scoresby) but that doesn't mean this cast isn't great too.The daemons seem to be less of a focus here than in the movie (presumably for budgetary reasons) with them notably being missing from many scenes but when they do appear they look great and you can see that a lot of money went into the animation budget for them and by extension the armoured bears. The series seems to do a better job at showing the connection between humans and their daemons and I like that Lyra's daemon Pan constantly changes form due to her being a child, something I don't remember being in the movie but is apparently accurate to the books.There seems to also be a multiverse aspect to the series which wasn't in the film but I assume is something from the books. As well as scenes in Lyra's world we also get scenes of characters in what is presumably our world, this can seem confusing and disjointed at first but it does start to make sense eventually and will surely be explored further as the series progresses.Overall a much better adaptation of this series, it's not for everyone and it's a slow start but if you can push through to the end then it's worth it. It will be exciting to finally see this story told from start to finish, something many have been waiting for since 2007.",8/10
6 November 2019,"I for one am glad I am coming into watching this without having read the books or seen the movie. Some reviewers say there are gaps and unanswered questions in this 1st episode. Now why SHOULD all the gaps and questions be filled/answered in the FIRST episode? That's just silly. It's an episodic show, not a movie. I like that this show makes me wonder/question. It makes me want to watch next Sunday's episode and those thereafter to see where the story goes and how the characters develop. I really don't need naysayers at such an early stage saying it's not adding up to the books. Give it time to breathe & grow.",8/10

26 December 2019,"Oh, how rarely BBC disappoints. And with good source material behind a production even less so. So in this adaptation of Phillip Pullman's acclaimed books a solid script was almost guaranteed. And foreign as said books are to me it's not my place to judge the series worth in terms of adapting a literature world into a TV series, but the script does keep the essence of a juvenile adventure story while being dark and gritty enough to make it more appealing for public of any age. Add a very talented cast really displaying their skills on the screen and, despite the occasional misteps and poorly executed scenes, it is more than enough to make 'His dark materials' stand out in current television rooster.It is visually, though, that the British production sucks you in and keeps you watching regardless your investment in the story. There's no flaw in the visual effects, the lightning and photography both at broad daylight and on nocturnal takes are on point and the camera work is truly magnificent in many scenes. Even in the weakest episodes or during storylines you're not interested in, there's so much to pay attention to, so many little details to behold it makes the episode fly by and leave you longing for more even if the cliffhangers ending each episode weren't there.It's yet to see what lays in wait for 'His dark materials' in the future, but everything in its debut season leads to believe it'll have no trouble covering the whole of its source material masterfully and claiming it's place as one of the best TV shows in the coming years.",7/10

Even the Bear is kind of tiresome.The 'Golden Compass' had most of the elements and energy that the series sadly lacks, including a tighter script and, as a result, better performances.",5/10

3 November 2019,"(I've read the books several times)
Episode 1-
I was looking forward to this and it hasn't disappointed! (a first for me, with fantasy adaptations)
Plenty of money has been thrown at this series and it shows, in a good way. Yet there's nothing Hollywood about it, it's 100% British.We're treated to a good bit of the background story during this episode, a thankless task, skilfully done and quite quickly. We're immediately thrown into the action and I am hooked, even though I know what's coming.The sets are amazing, the music excellent, the cast is A1: this is the BBC so it is exceptionally diverse -which is already giving us a bunch of fine actors that might not be so famous and gives us a bit of modern colour.
I'm not sure yet about Lyra, she's not what I expected but I've the feeling she'll turn out to be what was needed, if not what I wanted. Lord Asriel is just the right mixture of downright attractive and breezily self-centered as in the books. As to Mrs Coulter she's just fantastically and dangerously attractive. I finally understand what Lyra loved in her. The Gyptians are represented perfectly and individually and the whole thing has a tint of alternate medievality which mirrors the book exactly.All in all, episode 1 is a success.
I could go on and on but really, just watch it, you'll know after twenty minutes whether you'll like it or not.Episode 2: some fair deviations from the book, all in aid of story comprehension, suspense and doling appetising spoilers from much later to the viewer so that they won't drop off - you can't blame them really, they need to keep the viewership interested, considering the price of production. It's still very well done, and it's quite scary and tense, also the modern world (already shown) has been updated to current times. It looks like episode 3 will carry on with being rather different from the book storyline, while sticking to it at the same time, if that makes sense. It's rather on the dark side, and definitely not for children the way the books are.
Episode 3: I had minor doubts with episode 2 and the ""new"" storylines but this episode was very exciting and has allayed them. The whole thing is now moving forward properly and the plot is very tight in an action TV series sort of a way, without losing the spirit of the books. Back to a 9.The following episodes are a bit hit and miss, some pacing/acting /directing issues - Lee Scoresby the one unmitigated success - trying too hard to force suspense to fit the tv format rather than concentrate on telling the story as a one whole, but the last episode packs a punch and gets to you. And really leaves you hating having to wait a year for the rest, excellent finish.
UPDATE SERIES 2:While there were a few pacing/acting issues in series 1, the first 2 episodes of series 2 are nail-bitingly near perfect. Absolutely brilliant beginning and better visuals than ever. The plot and the world's are really well handled in every particulars. Persevere if you were in two minds about series 1.",8/10
4 November 2019,"Whilst it's hilarious reading reviews from certain religious quarters about them getting upset about their children being told fairy stories by an atheist, somehow we've all got to sit back whilst they tell their fairy stories. Well we've been doing that to good effect for two millennia - move over.Not sure about the plummy kids they've picked for Lyra and Roger. Their accents are all over the place.It looks good but it feels a bit too polished for me. It doesn't feel like it's got a soul. It's all shiny without much more going off.

8 November 2019,"After the first two minutes, I thought ""Oh Dear"". To my mind, there were two glaring faults :-
1. Asriel brings Lyra to Jordan college by helicopter - a helicopter is far too modern a device for the period that the book depicts.
2. Asriel addresses the Master of Jordan College as ""Asriel"", rather than ""Master"" when he requests scholastic sanctuary. Maybe he meant to say ""I am Lord Asriel"", but that isn't what it sounds like.Happily, those are my only real complaints. After that, the story reasonably well - I particularly liked the scene where the Gyptians' narrowboats are travelling through the Fens. There were places where the pacing seemed to drag a bit, but it could have been a lot worse. Similarly, the acting seemed somewhat wooden at times, but was passable. I expect future episodes to be more exciting. 7 out of 10.",7/10

22 November 2019,"I'm honestly so disappointed with this show. I love these books so dearly, I've studied them in depth and written essays on them, and this show doesn't do it justice.The casting is awful, the Golden Compass Movie may have completely abandoned the true plot, but that Lyra was absolutely perfect. Dafne Keen just isn't right, her only emotion seems to be raising her voice in anger. Lyra is supposed to be incredibly vibrant, imaginative, clever and Dafne portrays none of those things, she just comes across as a moody teenager constantly yelling at everyone. I find her acting so terribly annoying that I can barely watch this series. I love Ruth Wilson, but her portrayal doesn't express that indescribable charm and poise that is so essential to Mrs Coulter's demeanour, something Nicole Kidman embodies perfectly.Secondly, where are all the deamons? They're so essential to this story, they're a part of every character that represents their true personality. They should be with the characters at every moment, so much so that the idea of someone who doesn't have one is repulsive, and yet most scenes don't include them, just implying that they're somewhere unseen off to the side. I understand that they're expensive to animate, but you shouldn't commit to making a series like this if you can't afford to depict such an important aspect of the story.I'm also confused about how much plot information is being revealed so early on. In Episode 2, Lyra breaks into Mrs Coulter's Office and finds blueprints for what they're building at Bolvangar, which does not happen in the books and has completely spoiled the dramatic revelation for what will happen later. In Episide 1, Lord Asriel thoroughly explains exactly what his plans are in the North, even explaining what Dust is, Lyra is supposed to spend the whole book desperately searching for what this curious word Dust means, and Lord Asriel keeps his experiments shrouded in mich more mystery from the scholars. I understand this may seem to be nitpicking but the plot of Northern Lights, and the reason Lyra is so desperate to go North is a desire to learn more about Dust and they've seemingly taken that away.The producers have tried to go for a more Game of Thrones approach and depict multiple storylines and characters at once, rather than following the story through Lyra's eyes and finding out information as she does, but I feel this falls flat and will backfire on them later. We are already being introduced to characters and plot points that don't come into effect until much later in the books, and now those moments won't have the same gravitas when they come around, or will there just be lots of scenes of Lyra being explained things we already know?I'm honestly just very confused by this series, and I'm so utterly disappointed in it, I've been looking forward to it since I first heard it was commissioned. Maybe I just have too high expectations or the books are just too close to my heart for me to ever be happy with a series, but I actually enjoyed the Golden Compass Film until they did away with the ending. I'm honestly surprised that Phillip signed off on all this, it doesn't feel like whoever had translated it to the screen understood the appeal of the books in the first place.Although it's very highly rated so I guess it's enjoyable as a stand alone series, for those who haven't read them or just don't know them as well as I do.",2/10

4 January 2020,"Not sure if this constitutes a valid review of the series - I watched only a few minutes of the first episode. Actually, I spent more time reading many of the reviews here.May I start by asking why anyone would want to see a book turned into a film/series? In my experience, books and films are two different things, so that for a successful translation, the book-mode (as it were) must be converted to film-mode. Examples are The Bourne Identity and a fair number of adaptations of Phil Dick's stories. But if a book merely needs illustrating, then surely it has failed as a book?Two apects of the series stood out for me:
1. Oxford's dreaming spires and I saw Inspector Morse, and I realised that we were back in this peculiar English never-never land where harmless fantasies serve only to sustain an already out-moded culture.2. Children running through college, their animal-demons (real?) prominent, loads of workers and academics about and not a single animal-demon among them. It was then I realised that this adaptation would not work. If they were not going to give all characters animal-demons, then they should have found another way of representing that aspect of the story, perhaps tattoos (very popular) or even dinky badges.Pity, really. The title has always intrigued me and I looked forward to having that - somewhat cursory - curiosity satisfied.The points are for the quality of the production, which I'm sure will be maintained to beeb standards.",5/10
28 December 2020,"It looks like one of those PBS dramas from the 1970s. This pales in comparison to the Golden Compass. I'm sorry, but it's as though they assigned a bunch of high school students to film this. I have tried to watch this, but it's just been an effort.",1/10
3 February 2021,"I was requested by a friend to watch this show when season 1 came out and I declined. Talking animals in a show aimed for adults? Really? I thought that the CGI must be terrible and I turned it down. I also turned down the request to watch season 2 with them. I wondered how the show even got a second season. However, one night I got bored and I decided to stick on an episode. Wow... I was hooked. This show is amazing and I found myself watching 3 episodes a night and finished it pretty quick.Something I was not aware of is the fact this show is an adaptation of a book. This usually worries me a little, but just from the opening theme (which is amazing) I can tell the author had a lot of involvement in this show and from what I can tell, the show does an amazing job at staying true to the books. I fell in love with almost every character and I sympathised with them. I was able to feel sorry for the characters. And the CGI is amazing... wow. Sometimes the talking animals (known as daemons) look like they've actually got an animal on set and they don't make the concept cheesy. I literally don't have any criticism. Probably if I milked the show down to its finest details, then I would maybe find some, but nothing from what I can tell.Honestly, it has been over a month since watching this show and I want to go back and watch it again. It has some light hearted themes, but also some mystery and season 1 can get very dark. I really enjoyed this show, I highly recommend to anyone!",10/10
26 November 2019,"I understand, adapting a book for the screen isn't an easy job. After all the book let's you imagine the characters in your mind and it's difficult to associate the cast and acting with what audiences have in mind. We each have our own memory of the book and the details so it may not depict the book as it is in our heads. However...As a huge fan and reader of the trilogy, I can say that I am very disappointed. To me, this is one of the best books that have been ever written in human history. Not just because it's fantasy but also because it is very humane.I feel particularly sad for the writer. I wonder if he is really content with the result as he is also the executive producer of the series.The book gets personal. The characters and daemons have their own personality, their own voice and choices. They have flaws. They have will. People are at war with themselves. You can feel all the human traits, emotions, struggles and people grow and change. It's the life itself that's contained in the trilogy.However, so far in 4 episodes I still cannot feel that. The casting couldn't be worse. I can't connect with anyone in the story. Can't feel the character traits. Take Lyra for example. She is supposed to be a witty, curious and brilliant girl who questions things. The one portrayed in the show is nothing quite like her. Just a girl who is naughty, whiny and snob and cold.Actually most of the lead characters are the ones that are weak and lack the feeling. The supporting actors and actresses do a much better job.The more I watch these episodes the more I like the 2007 movie the Golden Compass which was an adaptation of the first book called the Northern Lights. It was criticised by avid fans back then but at least it delivered some of the most crucial aspects of the story in a logical and informative manner. Even if you didn't read the books you could understand what was going on. The series fail miserably in this regard.The movie casting was impeccable compared to this one. The leading roles like Lyra, Lord Asriel, Mrs Coulter, Serafina Pekkala, the Texan, they portrayed and performed much better. They were strong enough to etch an image of their character on your mind.The movie had more limited time than the series but it still managed to tell the viewers the story with a natural flow. It gave some feeling even though it might not be reflecting the book properly.As a huge fan I don't see that on the show. The series just keeps jumping from one point to another. Most characters are off. This could have been a feast but it's just a sandwich (and not even like the ones you make at home). I will try to watch the first season with some hope left inside. Because that's what the books taught me.",5/10

Don't compare this to the American Hollywood rip-off Golden Compass which flopped as it deserved as it was a terribly bad adaptation.
Currently reading the books as well, adaptation is done really well.
And people who give this low ratings and compare it to harry potter are insane. I also love harry potter, but this is not comparable, it's like comparing football to car racing.

Seems like people these days just dont understand what a book is or how to read one, i loved the movie but the show seems spot on so far, also some people giving out that its on late and wondering why as its a ""kids"" show....if you've read the books you would know it gets very dark. Anyway Loving the show so far, i will be watching every week.",9/10
3 November 2019,"I found it amazing that they are making this series. The story is really amazing and with such a talented cast, I can see this going far. Also nice is that every book will get a season in the show. It will certainly be a lot better than the movie, let's see how the story continues...",9/10
5 December 2020,"I haven't read the books, I did see the forgettable Golden Compass however, and that was shockingly average compared to this.Season One did an amazing job of setting the groundwork for what becomes an exciting and action packed Season Two. So far we're on episode four at the time of writing this review. There were endless questions raised in Season One which we start to address in Season Two. What is the connection between Lyra and Will, what is Dust, what happened to Will's Dad, is he truly dead? The action ramps up in this season. Personally I enjoyed Season One but I did find it a little boring, but I accepted it was laying the groundwork for something more complex and grandiose in Season Two.As with Season One the CGI is movie quality, the acting is great too despite some reviews indicating that Will's character is badly acted. It's not. Will's character is just different to Lyra and starts to come into his own in Episode Four of Season Two.Should you watch this? If you enjoy movie production values as it relates to sets, costumes, CGI, acting and story then yes. If you enjoy fantasy, dystopian realities and are into how science intersects with religion and faith, then yes. If on the other hand you judge everything you watch based on your political beliefs (which is borderline fanatical by the way) with comments such as 'it's so woke', (what does that even mean!?!) you probably won't enjoy this, or literally anything else in the Universe. It's based on a book written before some large groups of people started to judge everything through an ideological lens. I didn't like my Bagel this morning, it was too Woke.But seriously, it's another incredible collaboration between BBC and HBO. I hope it reigns for many years to come.
It's smart.Well established actors keep popping up.Newly introduced characters have depth and are interesting, adding to the story.It's completely fictional (not woke).Season One: 8/10
Season Two (So far): 9/10",
5 November 2019,"Lyra is played and cast well. However everyone else is miss-cast, especially Ruth Wilson, and it feels dragged out. The writing is tedious and dull.

It didn't disappoint!The creators have decided not to follow the books moment to moment but do it their own way, and I think the series will be all the better for it. It is impossible to cram all the details of a book into a couple of hours and some of the best book to screen adaptations I have seen (Willy wonka and the chocolate factory, the devil wears Prada) are quite different to the books.With that said, the series itself is full of atmosphere and intrigue, with gorgeous landscapes, music and perspective, just like the books. Perfect for the run up to Christmas!I think the creators have focused on creating a solid and enjoyable watch that will appeal regardless of whether you have read the books and it looks like they have succeeded.I can't wait to see Lyra's next steps in her adventure!",8/10

Good production values and it seems as though it will be true to the book with actors who can carry it off.

31 October 2020,"Awful. Never read the books but saw the movie. Yet another Mary Sue character (yes, I'm aware that's probably the case in the books, but that was probably when having strong female protagonist was both rare and cool). Completely spoiled brat of a child that has to have everything her own way and it all works out for her.How did this get a second season? Also, Dafne Keen can't act. I know actors, especially child actors have to start somewhere, but No. Just NO.You have a real problem show/script /story when the best scenes/acting are the CGI polar bear",1/10
14 October 2020,"As someone who has read the HDM trilogy several times and listened to the BBC semi-dramatised audiobooks several more I awaited this version with bated breath.For the most part the script is faithful to the novels; an adaptation will never be a novel converted into scrips and some changes, such as the introduction of Will in series one, work well. What lets this version down is the casting and overall design: while Ruth Wilson stands out as an excellent piece of casting, some of the other characters just don't work such as Ma Costa and Lee Scorsbee. Additionally, although I agree with diverse casting and this cast is very diverse, it defeats the object of the exercise if the final product looks like the diversity has been enforced by a clipboard wielding member of the BBC diversity department, which it does here.This story is set, (mainly), in a parallel universe where a person's soul walks next to them and interacts with them, polar bears can talk and reason and other creatures have evolved that don't exist at all in our universe. This is not reflected in the visual effects which show familiar looking light fittings, helicopters and boat engines ant this gives a feeling of laziness.Overall though this is a good piece of entertainment, but it does leave you with the feeling that Netflix or Amazon could have made a much better job of it.",5/10

13 November 2019,So far its a near perfect start! Im so effing happy right now ^^.,10/10
22 January 2020,Let me start off by saying I don't know anything about the original source material. First off the acting in this show is tremendous. Ruth Wilson absolutely steals the show in every scene she is in and impressively out shines James McAvoy. You can just feel the energy she brings to the screen. Dafne Keen is amazing and she brings the charm and James McAvoy is James McAvoy. The visuals are very impressive for the Daemons and you can feel their personality. One thing I dislike is whenever they switch back and forth to different worlds it kind of stops the momentum of the show.,9/10
7 January 2020,"I must say, that opening sequence is a blessing for my ears and eyes. It bewitches you right off.The show itself is quite alluring, too. It has the heavy aura of mystery, eeriness and subtle magic. It is propelled by the good old adventure story with a ""chosen one"" protagonist, but as the episodes progressed, I was pleased to see the extra layers in some secondary, morally grey characters and though - provoking themes the show only begins to explore in the last few episodes.Visually, it is fairly impressive, but that is to be expected of HBO/BBC production. A few sequences of arctic scenery in particular are worthy of some award for visual effects. In fact, this is one the finest looking shows I've seen in a while. I always appreciate when extra effort is put in that department. CGI is good as well.As for the acting, everybody praises Dafne Keen who is breakthrough young star indeed. But for me, this show was entirely stolen by Ruth Wilson's performace. I would very much like to see her with an award for this. Her Mrs Coulter is a piece of work. Then there is James McAvoy who is one of the finest actors out there, but gets very little screentime as his character is more developed further on in the story. He was excellent though. Steals each scene he is in. So yes, came for McAyov, stayed for Wilson.
And also, kudos to the young actor who plays Roger, he was wonderful.As for the negatives, there isn't much. Some of the pacing was a bit off and it dragged in a few points, but I was not bothered with occasional slower tempo. It takes time to build quality suspense and mystery. The parallel narrative they introduced halfway through clashed a bit with the style of the main one, but it all came full circle in the end.All in all, don't expect new Harry Potter or GoT it has fantasy elements of it, but His dark materials is a beast of its own and the first season builds a solid base from which to grow further. Give it a try, I'm looking forward to next season.",9/10
1 December 2019,"The show is just painful to watch. Most of the characters are stupid and do completely illogical things. I know Dafne Keen is joung but even Steven Seagal is a better actor.
Save yourself some time and just watch the The Golden Compass instead, apart from the CGI everything is better in that movie.",5/10
20 March 2020,"I didn't like anything in the series. The stories are badly told, a lot of loose ends. I don't understand how Ruth Wilson can work as an actress, she is just the most overacting artificial person. And the worst of all, it was quite boring, mostly because how badly the story is told.",2/10

25 November 2019,It really bugs me that only the protagonists have daemons ad even these are shown as seldom as possible. I know CGI is very expensive but in this case it's the biggest part of world building to give every single person in Lyra's world their daemon.,

6 January 2021,"Without all the prior knowledge of all the characters, settings and plotlines, this show is high concept as F, because the show actually treats audiences as they are novels fans who already know what is about to happen.For normal humanbeings, It only shows very litlle of a story, you will not be able to understand what logic is applied, characters will act like schizophreniacs, completely unstable for no apparent reason, stupidity all over the placeBasically, don't bother unless you already did.",4/10

18 August 2021,"If you loved reading the book series, then you absolutely need to see this series! I was first introduced to the books when I saw the 2007 Golden Compass film in theaters and I loved it so much I decided to check out the books, but that film was an absolute disgrace to the books. This series, however, is not. It stays true to the books and even expands on it without creating any plot holes or leaving out any major information or creating any major confusion like most shows would. One thing I really liked was that around the second half of the first season, they started to introduce the beginning of the second novel that was told mainly through flashbacks. Another change that was awesome was that the timeline of the show is a bit more ""modern."" The book series was written in the late 1990s, so our world that one of the major characters, Will Parry, is from is described as a ""typical '90s kid,"" whereas in this series, the timeline is in the current time BEFORE the pandemic so we see everything in our world as it is today, for example, Will has a cell phone and the cars are more modern. There's also another really big change from the novels that was originally in the 2007 film that this series decided to keep in, but despite making the change, they kept it as close to the book as they could get (exact same scenario happened, just to a different character) and they did it in a way that enhanced the drama and showed the real severity of the situation. Any other change they made that wasn't in the novels, they did in a way that did not lessen the show's value or create story plot holes. No surprise there really considering that one of the show's executive producers is Philip Pullman, the author of the book series. The visual effects are absolutely outstanding. The way the characters, daemons, different worlds, creatures, and even the alethiometer is presented the exact way it is described in the novels. If you've never read the books but absolutely love epic sci-fi fantasy-action adventure dramas that tackle the topics of conquering evil, believing in yourself, standing up and fighting back against oppression, and how one person can make all the difference, then this is the show for you!!",10/10
5 November 2019,I'll try again but it was just kind of boring. Was it supposed to be geared to a younger audience - maybe 12? That's a genuine question. Dust? I wasn't interested enough to watch the entire first episode. Some visuals were good but not enough to carry the show.,4/10
21 April 2021,"I have not read the books yet, i do pretend to, so i can't say about it beign a good adaptation of the series or not, what it is tho, is a good tv show, the first season suffers a bit with the pacing but the overall story keeps you interested if you put a little effort, the second season on the other hand pulls you in instantly, i binge watched the entirety of the second season in one day, really hope they dont cancel this show, beacuse it is really good and has great potential to be even better.",9/10
24 December 2019,"Nor as deeply intelligent. I believe that contemporary series makers (with a few exceptions) take powerful and disturbing books ad turn them into cartoons. There is far too much Star Wars razzle dazzle, wham pow here; and not enough portrayal of real human violence, real human cruelty. Pullman's subtle and elegant understanding of dust has become the rebellion of an adolescent against the adult world. I had to make myself watch the last 3-4 episodes out of a loyalty to the book. The worst I can say about them is that I was bored.",2/10

21 November 2019,"I'm very confused that people are saying it's a great adaptation. It's not!! By the end of episode 2 it had gone so far from the first book!! Firstly, I cannot understand why BBC take a book where every character is described in such detail and then put in actors who are - with the sole exception of the Lyra character - absolutely nothing like their description. Then the BBC blows the entire mystery of the book by continuously showing people slipping between the two worlds! As a result, instead of the mystery of the story slowly unfolding the BBC throw into our face a jumpy, back-and-forth journey. Episode 2 shows completely fictional scenes of Mrs Coulter ransacking Jordon College. But the worst thing is that the ethereal, slightly magical, feel of the book is totally lacking, especially with regard to the Gyptians. Such a disappointment.",3/10

But then it jumps ahead and many of the developments felt unearned. Especially the very close relationship between the bear and Lyra is weird, since they share very little screen time. Of course, the audience can be expected to fill in some blanks but it's a little too much. I want to like it, but it has to improve.",5/10
3 December 2021,"I really want to like and was very much looking forward to it. Season 1 was somewhat boring but laid a decent foundation, so I was hopeful for S2. The show is quite well made from a technical point of view. Unfortunately none of the characters are engaging or ever seem like normal people. In very wooden dialogues they go on about how they love each other and how brave the children are but I never felt anything for any of them (except Iorek, he's great). Even Ms. Coulter is neither threatening nor beautiful, she's just weird for no reason.",5/10

2) I never saw so many black people in Oxford.........I was a student at Oxford.
Yeah....the second part of that statement sort of explains the first. As a student at Oxford, I'm guessing you never went anywhere south of Cowley, like maybe Blackbird Leys ??!! Also, you seem to have missed the whole alternate world bit. We are being shown Lyra's Oxford here. Are these characters black or white in the books, and does it matter? Perhaps this had the Executive Producer's blessing, may have even been his idea?!!
3) Sort of GOT, but for children. Yes, well done. This is based on a trilogy of books that were written for children. You are very good.
4) Why leave things out from the books and then add other things to pad it out? Well, maybe the Executive Producer ( you know, the author) decided to make , or authorise changes that he liked? No ?
5) This is a ripoff of the film "" The Golden Compass"". I pray that the person who left this comment has my sense of humour.
6) seems to be Harry Potter lite. Credit where credit is due, others have already quickly pointed out which was written first, but as per my title, this made me laugh. Spot the non-readers out there.

I haven't, I'm just discovering this story. The setting, the world is not very well explained and honestly the characters are not very likable. I'm not particularly fond of anyone so far. The acting is also weird and doesn't make sense sometimes. Not sure if it's the director or the actors themselves, but the acting feels rushed at times and not really convincing. And it's all happening too fast. Why would a school/university allow a small girl to leave with a woman she just met? Shouldn't they ask her uncle? And why does Lyra trust her?

It's simply not believable, especially considering we are to believe at least one villain will use clever trickery to get what they want.

21 December 2020,"I watched the TV series before turning to the books. Reading the books, it was as I'd suspected - it became clear why the TV show felt a bit strange and confusing - it leaves so much out (while also adding a fair bit of it's own). There are some particular scenes in the TV show which simply don't fully make sense and thus just seem a little weird, and then you read the book and you see the bits they cut out prior to the scene, and then understand what the scene was referring to.In particular, the TV show cuts a lot of the explanation of things and replaces it with just a sense of 'mystery' about what this is all about, where in the book you actually get explained things a lot more. This is most damaging when it comes to things like character motivation - I found it harder to relate to the characters when you don't so fully get to know them or understand their story and their motivations and thus why they're doing things and making certain choices.
You also get often this feeling in the first season especially that certain things are supposed to be important/climactic, but because of what was cut, they lack sufficient build-up to really achieve this effect.All that said, it does a decent job, but I'd recommend reading the books.",8/10

It does look visually impressive though; hence the 2 stars.",2/10
12 April 2020,"The books are among my very favorites, and I believe the audio version is perhaps the best audio adaptation ever. I had very great high hopes for this series, thinking Ruth Wilson, who is generally fantastic, to be a great choice for Mrs. Coulter. I also thought that Dafne Keen would make a really good Lyra. With a good script and good direction, they could have formed the heart of a great show, but they didn't get either. Every deviation from the book was awful, Lee Scorsby sad, early and extra explication of Lord Boreal terrible, Will showing up in part 1 and so weakly characterized - a disaster, and many more. Also, this did nothing to change my very low opinion of CGI.
The movie version was a good bit better, and if the scenes had been properly ordered would have been quite good. I made it through the penultimate episode, and my desire to see more was quenched. No more for me. It is outstanding source material, so maybe someday someone will do it justice, this isn't that day.",2/10
12 November 2019,"Although it's too early to rate the show based on the pilot, it is crystal clear that scenarists have taken their jobs seriously and actually adapted the book unlike the movie. I look forward to it, but it's a promising start.",
10 December 2020,"... this left me so underwhelmed. There is simply no sense of awe. Perhaps in this age of SFX and rousing film scores we expect more. But really this is direction, or the lack of it. None of the early episodes were directed or edited to linger on the magnificence of the story. Its been filmed in the BBC way - fast cuts, hectic pace to squish in the story and/or cover up the lack of budget. It is Doctor Who meets Pullman, and recently the BBC has not been very successful at either.
So loved the books, but not the adaptation. The likes of HBO and now Amazon and Netflix have spolied us to make us want more and sadly for me this didn't deliver.",4/10
25 November 2019,But definitely hits top gear by episode 4. Terrific acting particularly by the lovely Ruth Wilson and Lin-Manuel Miranda.,10/10
1 December 2019,"Having read the trilogy, twice I've wanted to see this wonderfully inventive and moving tale successfully realised on screen. I didn't hate the film but it didn't quite sit right with me - lacking subtlety and complexity perhaps. Not so this adaptation! I love the often surprising casting giving us multi dimensional portrayals of each character rather than the one note film offerings. Lyra is perfect, and there's real acting quality in the surrounding cast. The deamons are perfectly realised, very quickly making you think that they are the norm! I keep expecting my own cats to talk back to me! Whilst it's doubtlessly visually sumptuous, It doesn't rely on that to carry it, it's got so much heart & depth ive laughed & cried and been awed week on week . It's nigh on impossible to match a book on screen but what this does so well is capture the books essence - yes it takes some liberty's & misses things but the makers are clearly fans so that's fine - it's a magical treat which we look forward to every Sunday and are now dreading it ending - you can't ask for better Sunday viewing - tho be warned, the word dark is there for a reason so younger viewers could struggle",10/10
2 September 2020,"Let me start off by saying I have read the books and seen the stage show at the theatre (incredible by the way - go if you get the chance!). The majority of the casting I love - particularly Lyra and Lee Scorsby. Lin is amazing in everything and I think Lyra in this series is far better and more believable as a strong character than the girl in the golden compass. The one aspect I am not a fan of is the voices for the daemons and the armoured bears, they seem very unbelievable to me (and yes I know they are talking animals). I think the casting for Ma Costa, Mrs Coulter and Asriel was also spot on. Looking forward to where series two goes!",9/10
25 February 2020,"I had high hopes for this one after the movie adaptation from 2007 left so much to be desired, alas this series too doesn't deliver. The unmotivated cast is merely reading lines, probably while trying not to fall into the massive plot holes which are lying around a plenty.
The camera work is terrible, the actors' skin looks like they have been treated with an iron wash cloth. The actress who plays Lyra is as bad a cast as the movie version was. They just can't seem to find the right girl for this role.
I assume those who rated the show high are fascinated by the amazing story and ignore all the flaws. But one is probably better off to stick to the wonderful books by Philip Pullman.",5/10
24 November 2019,"Boring, unlikeable characters, sloooooow... I *should* like this- it tics all the boxes, and yet its a struggle to make it through an episode. I can only take 20 minutes at a time.

19 July 2021,"I've read the books when I was in school, back in the days in the early 2000's.There was a movie around 2007-2008, I thought it was good but really not as much as this series, which is closest to the original story of the books, in my opinion.To those who read the books, it's a MUST.That's also a really enjoyable show for anyone who didn't read the books. It's not an american blockbuster.Really well done, you can see there was a lot of budget put into it!I just can't wait for season 3 to be released!",8/10
16 November 2019,How HBO could use such an enormous budget to make this snooze fest is beyond me! Wow is this show boring! The movie and the books were great. This is not them. This is a boring period fantasy piece with a liberal twist. Better than Ambien though.,1/10
7 January 2020,Continual exposition make this the most boring show of recent times. It has fighting armoured bears and is boring! That is saying something.

19 November 2019,"After watching the first episode of this series I was so intrigued that I finally decided to read the books. To cut a long story short I enjoyed them so much I basically binge read all 3 in the space of a week. I was happy as well because after viewing the first episode of HDM it seemed to me they were going to stick pretty close to the book narrative. Something that rarely happens with TV or movie adaptations.Fast forward to episodes 2 and 3 and my initial joy was somewhat dampened as they started to seriously screw around with the narrative. For those that haven't read the books, the notion of travelling between different parallel worlds isn't really explored until the very end of the book 1. In fact the entire first book is focussed almost entirely on Lyra and her adventures. I think Pullman made a great choice writing it that way as it allows the reader to really connect with Lyra as a character without any distracting side plots intruding on the narrative. At least that was my experience when reading Northern LightsSo I was a little bit peaved in episode 2 and 3 to see they had decided to introduce a distracting side plot with Lord Boreal jumping from one world to the other at will.I can kind of see why they did it because theoretically all that stuff was probably happening concurrently in the original books timeline....we just weren't privy to it. However, just because you can do something (with a TV adaptation), doesn't mean you should. Personally I think it's a mistake. For viewers new to the story it must be a little confusing and for those familiar with the tale its just annoying. A lose/lose situation if you will. They would have been much better served (at this stage) concentrating solely on Lyra as Pullman did in the first book.On the whole though I am enjoying this adaptation. The production values are very high and the casting is good. Dafne Keen as Lrya (even though she looks nothing like the book version) was a good choice I think. I just hope they don't stray to far away from the original narrative for the rest of the series. There's a reason why the books were so successful.......why stuff around with what works?",9/10
18 November 2021,"Only up to s1 e4, rewatching it from when I first saw it on telly. Its got some great actors, the world building is phenomena, and the ideas behind it are great. So why, why of whys, is it so utterly boring? The acting is stilted and lifeless, with characters devoid of personality and at best embodying about one trait. The writing is truly awful, there are no moments of wit or charm at all. Characters just speak in long lines of dry, bland generic speech. The meeting of the Gyptians is a particular cringe inducing moment, the most hackneyed and dull depiction of good type rebel characters you can imagine, with speeches of supposedly rousing enthusiasm so cliche ridden they put you to sleep. The plot feels aimless and meandering, go to this and then go to there and then back to here. Yawn. It depends like 4 episodes going from point 1 to about point 1.5. It's appalingly paced. Scenes will just pop out of nowhere, seemingly add nothing, then go, brief flashes of the plot scattered across an episode without even feeling as if they culumating into anything meaningful. Lyrics too so far seems to be falling into the most dreary and predictable fantasy chosen one tropes, a Mary sue who manages to grasp incredible feats (such as reading the aetheliometer through instinct alone). The world too, as mentioned before, despite the obvious creativity and ingenuity behind it, is utterly charming in charm or life. Most of the time it looks like boring shots of Oxford or boring shots of Lindon or boring shots of ships. Theyres just nothing interesting about it.So, its rubbish, and gratitiously overrated. I remember watching it the first time it came out, and feeling just like this. I've been watching S.1 again to see if I was wrong. Yah, I wasn't.",4/10
25 November 2019,"I'm a fan of HBO and most of its productions, but this is just a new low. I've watched 4 episodes so far and as someone who hasn't read the books, I have no idea what's going on. Daemons - not really explained how they work, magisterium - also not explained how it works or what it is, dust?? Overall everything seems completely random at all times. Another big disappointment is that I gave it a chance because of James McAvoy, turns out he has 10 minutes airtime for the whole season in the first episode. Boo!On another note, please stop portraying children as adults. No child talks like this. Again someone with no understanding of children has written their lines and it's painful to watch. Almost every dialogue is unbearable and too damn long, feels like an episode is a couple of hours.3/10 is maybe too generous,but considering that I watched 4 episodes, perhaps fair. If you haven't though, don't waste your precious time.",3/10

Nothing new, a girl is missing her daddy, her friends are missing their daddies.Their daddies are missing their daddies.This goes is the story for 70% of the time.The other 30% is that whatever matters in the movie is in the hands of some unknown gift of our tennager protagonist.I can't wait for all the episodes to come, just to see how in the end we MIGHT understand what her gift is and how she will make a poker face and beat everyone in a snap of a finger.Congratulations on bringing type of movie, finally I can re-watch - Stranger Things, Godzilla - King of monsters, Godzilla vs Kong, Ender's Game, the new Power Rangers, the new Mutants, the Witcher, The Girl with all the gifts, Kick-Ass 1,2, Pacific Rim 2 etc...I can't wait for them to copy-paste such scripting into the Lord of the rings, Game of thrones, The godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Mission Impossible...

5 November 2019,"I despair at some reviewers on here. How can anything be given a rating of '1' especially if they haven't even watched the whole of an episode? The start of any such series will need to build a story and will take a while to develop characters. The scenery and CGI alone must warrant a high rating given the atmospheric mood they create. You just can't please some people who seem to think this stuff is easy!I enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to the rest, to watch the story unfold. However, I won't add a rating at the moment because I haven't seen enough to judge it fairly. Ignore the '1' and '2' ratings - I think there's a low IQ convention in town.",9/10

I can't relate to their achievements nor can I feel threatened for their hide.And I can surely tell it's not one of the good adaptations even though I've never read the books. If a book is as popular as these books are, then they must've had relatable objects, which, sadly missing so far. 4 episodes in, can't say there will be any.Give it a try, if you wish.

6 November 2019,"I'm a huge fan of the books and I've been looking forward to this so much! Thoughts on the first episode is that they seem to be keeping more to the books than the movie did. Casting is just okay, again could have been slightly better. The only casting that really bothered me was Ma Costa as she was nothing like the character in the books. I'm a little worried about Lee Scoresby too, as he should be MUCH older than the actor who has been cast. Doesn't work with the story or the timeline at all.Overall, my biggest complaint is the lack of daemons. I've seen that the author has already addressed this and explained that it's a mix of budget and not wanting every scene to be overun by animals. I understand but I'm still disappointed.Oh, and to the reviewers complaining about the pronounciation, it IS pronounced DEMON, not ""daaaymon""!Despite these minor gripes, as a whole show I really did enjoy it and I'm looking forward to watching the rest.

22 December 2019,I was waiting for this premier based on all the media hype and the intriguing preview trailers. I did'nt finish the golden compass movie nor have I read the books. I was very disappointed with the first three episodes and cant bring myself to watch anymore. These actors and actresses are absolutely first rate. I've seen them in movie and TV masterpieces so it is NOT a failure in casting or acting. I guess this is a directing issue or an editing failure because the series has squirm worthy scenes that just cant allow me to suspend my reality and enter the world presented. I'm starting to distrust IMBD ratings since this one is still so high. I kept watching trying to see if I was missing something and I realize I'm not.,4/10

23 December 2019,"I had high hopes for this series after watching the initial few episodes, but after watching the first season I feel this could have been much better.For the most part the acting was good. I particularly enjoyed the performances by Dafne Keen (Lyra), Lucian Msamati (John Faa), Ariyon Bakare (Charles Latrom), James Cosmo (Farder Coram) and Anne-Marie Duff (Ma Costa). I was less impressed with Ruth Wilson as Mrs. Coulter, and Ruta Gedmintas' performance as Serafina fell particularly flat.While I found the series overall to be much better than The Golden Compass, the final three episodes were, I thought, a bit of a letdown. The main problem was the pacing: many scenes which one assumes were intended to be climactic (e.g. the battle of the bears) didn't have sufficient build-up to really achieve this effect, and the material in the final episode ended up feeling particularly rushed.This really ought to have been done as a 10 or 12 episode season rather than an 8 parter so that much of the material could have been expanded to give it the detail that it deserved.I'm really hoping that the next season will not be quite as rushed.A few comments on previous reviews. First, this series was based on the novel 'Northern Lights'. So was the film 'The Golden Compass'. This series was *not* based on that film.Second, I'm very confused as to why so many comparisons have been raised between this and Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. Apart from the fact that all three belong to the rather broad genre of 'fantasy' they have absolutely nothing in common (well, with GoT is shares the overly-rushed-at-the-end property, but that's about it).Finally, 'demon' and 'daemon' are the exact same word, just as 'archeologist' and 'archaeologist' are the same word. They mean the same thing and are pronounced exactly the same way (a few people have brought up the Unix pronunciation. Yes, that's sometimes different, but unix people also think 'gnu' has a hard g and that 'vi' is pronounced 'six' so I wouldn't trust them where regular English is concerned).",7/10

7 November 2019,I watched the first episode today and it was really good. The CGI was amazing! I like the actors a lot.But...I've never read the books. So the story doesn't really make sense to me. When you create a series you need to give more explanation than three sentences to your audience because remember this isn't the book so it needs to explain where they are and how the world works. Because I don't know where Liara is. I don't know if it's a magic school. Religion school exedra.But that's my only negative about the story. Looking forward to next week's episode and hope they will explain more and if they do. Then I'll give it a 10/10!,8/10

30 April 2020,"Yes, the series is sort of a big thing with nice setups, brilliant pictures, good actors, and so on. Unfortunately the way of storytelling is just too similar to all those other mystery series and movies. This takes away very much from the original story and that almost hurts me as if somebody takes my personal dæmon far away from me (as it works in the story's parallel reality).It is my personal 'relationship' to the story which struck me some years ago. The enormous depth of the tale and the interconnected parts of physics, religion, and fantasy is for me some sort of giant achievement in storytelling. But allmost everything that makes His Dark Materials so special is lost in this series. For me watching the episodes is like seeing a black and white silent movie with 16 frames per second when you expect an 8K experience in 3D and surround sound. It does not necessarily mean that the movie is bad but the way the story is told just seems too lousy. Even the BBC radio play from 2003 has more depth in the main story than this brand new television series.Thus I must say that the artwork has thomething of a 7 or 8 out of 10 but the overall experience is much less than that.

4 November 2019,"The new adaptation of Philip Pullman's trilogy is the sort of lavish production you can expect from BBC and HBO. It looks as if no expense was spared.
Except... there's not enough daemons.
In Pullman's world, every person has his own companion animal. That means every character, every bit player, every extra. It's essential to the story and it will become even more essential as the story progresses.
Here, it seems only the major characters are allowed daemons, which is distracting to those people who know the books and confusing to those who are new to this world.
It's strange, because there are shots where there's some space left open for the daemons, but it seems like they they forgot to key them in.

I know the show is meant for a younger audience but plenty of other writers have created for this audience while showing respect for kids/teens' ability to parse things out on their own.His Dark Materials is paint by numbers YA shlock. This is the kind of series The Simpsons parodied in the episode where a handful of characters formulaically assemble their own YA novel in a cynical ""get-rich-quick"" scheme.

24 December 2019,"I am a TV show buff. I binge TV shows nonstop, but only once every couple years do I find a series that brings back my excitement and my love for TV. I was originally obsessed with the sadly discontinued movie franchise of The Golden Compass. When I found out HBO was creating a TV series adaptation, I couldn't have been more pleased. The world which author Philip Pullman has been able to create has allowed me to rediscover my love for fantasy and adventure. The concepts of other worlds, dust, daemons, and of course an alethiometer which tells necessary truths, truly captivates and entices my mind, immersing me deeply into this new and complex world of fiction. Not to mention the actors, as well as the characters they play, which make this world and this story so special. His Dark Materials has fed my soul from beginning to end. I am so thrilled to revisit this series in season 2. This will be the longest wait of my life, but every second is worth it.",10/10

13 March 2020,"I read the trilogy close to 15 years ago, and just re-read the first book to my 10 yo son before watching the series. We were both ultimately very frustrated by the changes from the book. I get that TV is a different medium, but there are changes (that I won't detail here to avoid spoilers) that either don't seem necessary or undermine details of the story. It also removes some twists rather early. The realisation of the characters, both real and CGI, are generally good, though they clearly cut corners on including daemons (you can see too often that one person in a crowd has one but the rest seem to be missing, so the feeling of everyone having one doesn't seem driven home). Some things from the book are retained, but their purpose is lost, rendering them pointless. Other things aren't explained enough. The lesson for me is to read the next book with my son well before the next series so we forget the details. :)",7/10
5 November 2019,"A really good start - I enjoyed watching this. Sumptuous and realistic sets and effects, except perhaps the daemons' eyes are a bit iffy.

I can understand fans of the books a exciting. But for an outsider.. sorry this is not good. Children will probably love it. For adults? yes if you are a fan or got a young mind - I guess.

This did not come across clearly in this episode as many people were missing their daemons. And worse still, they were referred to as demons. Demons are a very different thing, a nasty and dark thing and not at all what a daemon is. The whole concept of daemons is fundamental to the story. I hope this is cleared up over the forthcoming episodes. Otherwise it's a beautiful production, lavish and rich in imagery. I particularly liked Azrael's slideshow.",4/10

10 January 2021,"This series is great. Amazing production values, great directing and cinematography. Acting is ok.
I had read the books a long time ago, and really liked them. The adaptation is good, but they have written the script for children. The story and especially the dialogue has been written for an audience of quite a low age. It's actually more aimed at young teenagers. The books are more for young adults.
That said, I understand the producers decision to target a younger audience.
And they done a great job in making it just that.

28 December 2020,"Having never read the books, I've loved this series. Someone said in one of the reviews that the show is bleak, and it is. In the best possible way. The production, the script the acting are all fantastic, but it kind of has that understated gloomy feel that I've loved in the Frankenstein Chronicles and Penny Dreadful. It's different, has more humor than these two shows, but the mood is there.Also, for me the casting choices are far better than those in the movie. The characters feel real and relatable. I think that some of the distinguishing characteristics of the characters were toned down on purpose to achieve that effect. They are much more nuanced and interesting, unlike the over the top characters from the movie, which just felt fake for me.The plot might get a bit slow for some people, but give it a chance. Season two is even better than the first one, and I can't wait for season three.",9/10

I was greatly disappointed by The Golden Compass movie, so I was very happy to see the BBC and HBO doing right by the source material. Lyra feels much more like the fearless girl from the books, running through Jordan College with Roger. Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel also hold true to their characters.

I like the CGI bears, and James McAvoy. However, most of the other characters act as if they are in a stage play. It's very unnatural and disconnecting and makes me ask, why am I watching this? I do not care about anyone or anything happening. Is that the intent? Even the daemons have flat intonations, like boring slide shows. Are these actors simply line reading or were they directed to be emotionless? When someone says, ""I'm afraid,"" I need to feel there is something behind the statement.

This series captures the mood of the books and makes justice to most of the characters... It is darker, moody and very British! Just like the books. It is also visually well done. I was waiting for the next seasons and will recommend the series, the same I did with the books.

27 April 2020,"HDM is nothing like Harry Potter. I am guessing that the concept of a young child being a part of a big prophecy makes people immediately think of HP but as the show goes on you will really be able to see how much these two series differ. With all that being said I think that if you like HP you should definitely give HDM a go because it has a really strong storyline with a very strong young cast. In fact, HDM has a darker feel to it and deals with some heavier questions. I thought that both the younger and older actors were cast perfectly. What also impressed me was the quality of the CGI and the sound effects. You can clearly see that they didn't cut back on the budget like some previous book to movie adaptations.
I specifically wanted to write about Lin-Manuel Miranda. His character Lee -who by the way gave me serious Han Solo vibes- was for me definitely the most entertaining to watch, I just loved all the scenes that he was in. Hope that we can get to see more of his character in the second season. Also kudos to James McAvoy for his portrayal of Asriel, he made the character so easy to hate and I am not used to 'not' liking his characters at all. My only complaint would be that sometimes the pacing felt a little bit of. Especially when it cut from Lyra's side of the story to Will's side, I just kind of wanted to skip some parts of his storyline because it progressed way slower than Lyra's. But overall HDM is a great watch. I can only hope it gets the recognition it deserves in the later seasons.",9/10

They literally cut out entire extremely important characters that are crucial the the eventual evolution of the plot. Its and obscene embarrassment.The show is way to fast passed becuase of that. For any one who thinks this is developing slowly you actually a moron. You find out things in the first 4 episodes that you would never find out so soon. This show is produced with their instant gratification foot forward. A clear sign of stupidity. They tell you things way to directly leaving nothing to the imagination. They spoil their own plot.Also they have taken massive liberties with the plot and certain characters I wont mention. Certain things that never happened in the book happen in the show and Visa versa.It's quite unfortunate how certain elements that dont even come up until the end of the book or there other 2 books of the trilogy or in the first few episodes of this movie. These people are absolute morons.Inauthenticity, this series reeks of it. The cast they chose dont match the actuall characters them selves. The reason their acting looks so bad is becuase they are not meant for these roles. They are nothing like the orgi brothers al characters in the book.At least the Golden Compass movie had good actors for the assigned roles. Never mind the acting it was poorly written. Same thing goes for the show they are all great actors in their own right so as long as they get the right role and AUTHENTIC role.Ultimately the blame lies with Philip Pullman for approving this trash in the first place.",1/10
22 December 2019,"As a massive fan of the books, and being let down by 'the golden compass' film, my hopes weren't high. However, with season 1 done I've got to say, this show is amazing. It really has followed the books, almost down to the scene.
The characters, plot and cgi immerse you into Lyra's world, one not so dissimilar to our own, just a bit more magical. I mean, who wouldn't want a daemon!
The casting is perfect, Dafne Keen's Lyra with a steely determination tinged with a vulnerable naivety fits so well. Ruth Wilson dominating the role of Mrs Coulter, effortlessly stealing whichever scene she's in.
The series is shot beautifully aswell, especially towards the end and the use of the northern lights to illuminate the scene.
If you haven't read the books, you're in for a ride you won't believe. Don't let the fantasy elements of this show put you off if that's not your usual cup of tea. The show does a good job of grounding everything and making it relatable. Stick with the story, you'll never forget it.

3 December 2019,"The first thing readers of the books will notice is the P.C. ""inclusive"" casting. This is fine provided it does not change the nature or perception of the character or distract from the story. The head of Jordan college, Lord Boreal and John Faa are all played by black actors. This would be fine if the first two, particularly Boreal (over acted by Ariyon Bakare) weren't supposed to be part of the so called ""white patriarchy"". The casting choices alter first time viewers perceptions of the character and distract from the timeless nature of the story with 2019 identity politics.
Another jarring casting choice is thalidomide actor Mat Fraser as gyptian, Raymond Van Gerrit. Gyptians live on boats. I couldn't help thinking that someone with short arms may not have survived to middle age, again distracting from the story and taking the viewer out of the moment.
As a huge fan of the books there are many things about the BBC's version that irritate me. The writers spend way too much time on invented content and not nearly enough time on important issues and character development. It is as if they assumed that all viewers will have read the books and be able to fill in the gaps. Not nearly enough time is spent on Lyra's learning to use the Aleithiometer and she uses it in public, often, which would never happen in the books. The Old bear from Game of Thrones play's Farder Coram (badly) and one can't help but feel that he should have been cast as John Faa as he fits the description of the character in the books.
Solid, brave, trustworthy, Lee Scoresby is introduced as a thief in his first scene and in his conversation with Iorek the bear comes off as whiney rather than regal.
There are elements that are good. The introduction of Will's story line early on so as to overlap is interesting and promising and the relationship between Will and his Mother is well done. The only problem with this story line approach is that it introduces the idea of being able to cross into otherworlds (Boreal) too early in the story and takes away from what should be the climax of the first book, i.e. Lyra's crossing.
Lyra is well acted by Dafne Keen and is far less irritating than Dakota Blue Richard's version. (she doesn't say ""'ent"" too literally for starters) but her character is badly written.
Lucian Msamati does an excellent job as Lord Faa despite being an unusual casting choice, as does Ruth Wilson as Mrs Coulter although in my opinion the writers reveal her vunerable side way too early, depleting the strength of her character and making her less of an intimdiating threat.There is still more to be done to get a true picture of where they are going with this but so far it feels like a very superficial renderring and I doubt they have the budget to pull it off if the Bear scenes so far are anything to go by. I imagine they are saving it all for the land of the dead and the war with heaven. It ticks boxes but doesn't offer any depth, feeling or meaning. It's not really as bad as 1 star but we have to do something to bring the average down and combat all these idiots who are giving it 10/10.",1/10

10 December 2019,"Meh. The plotline deviates too far from the Pullman book and sort of paints itself into corners in doing so. It's hard to follow sometimes and nearly impossible for someone unfamiliar with it. Overall the casting and character integrity is horrible; many of the performers are just not that believable in the roles in which they were cast. For some reason, they changed Lee Scorsby into a Jar-jar-Binks-like character in the newly interpreted schmucky role. To top that boneheaded move, they cast Miranda to play the part (about as horribly as one would imagine he would). Can he at least pretend to have a Texas accent like he's supposed to? He's a talented guy, but he's not a screen actor, he's a broadway musical guy. Ugh. He's also a thief and all-around the way they wrote him. Why they went that route with one of the best characters in the book is beyond me. The cinematography and effects or fine; right up to Hollywood standards as should be expected given the budget and resources, so not a lot of points to be earned there. Overall, not bad to watch, but don't expect to be wowed. I'd give it a 6/10 but it spoils the opportunity for someone to actually produce the series in a way that does it justice, so it's lower than that.",5/10

11 December 2020,"I think the only reason this series is rated so highly is because the people rating it are big fans of the books and it's blinding them to the fact this is such a CRAP show! I had never heard of the books or the Golden Compass movie before I started watching the series, I just thought the trailer looked interesting and there seemed to be so many good actors in it (main character excluded). It is sooo incredibly bad! I watched all of season 1 and it never got better. The main character is such an annoying bore, I had to fast forward through her scenes she's so intolerable. Maybe 2 year olds would like this, but what a waste of money.",2/10

12 January 2020,"A brilliant adaptation of a legendary novel, there's not much I didn't enjoy about it.

Very much looking forward to the next series!",8/10
26 November 2020,"Figured I'd throw my two cents on the pile. I read the books a while ago, so they're foggy, but I remember their depth. I have to commend this adaption for going the distance. At heart, the show (so far) is about religious and political intrigue, navigated by children who are surrounded by flawed, cruel, and well-meaning adults. It's unique in not being overly veiled in metaphor: the show is about flawed religious institutions and being betrayed by the people who were supposed to protect you, and the show lays it out in detail. The show goes ahead and tells you at its center is what the church considers to be original sin. Hell yeah! It is also excellently casted, particularly (though not limited to) Dafne Keen as Lyra and Ruth Wilson as Mrs. Coulter.",10/10

4 November 2019,I am a huge fan of the book. I understand the ways productions need to go to make the Catholic Church and christians happy. They need to read the book like they did for Harry Potter. Then they would see it's a fantastic fantasy nothing more. Hbo released this tv show today. BBC released it on sun. The first episode was similar to the book. It a bit different. Adding but not leaving out anything. From the book. What they are adding and changing is a bit unnecessary. It dose not start the same place as the book. Again like the movie the tv show will be it's own thing. To bad bc the books are amazing. But I do have to say the first episode was so far better than the movie.,1/10
4 November 2019,"To this day I still do not know why the film failed to deliver. It might have been bad timing, or some other dark forces at work. Yet, more than a decade later, His Dark Materials is granted a new chance to acquire a long-promised but deserved status to literature masterpieces who hop into popular media.
Lyra's Jordan does exactly what it promises; it sets the foundations to the story, while taking time to describe Oxford - not our Oxford mind you, but one that could exist somewhere else. The college, the Gyptians and their customs, the Cobblers - with Asriel, Mrs. Coulter and, of course, Lyra in the midst of all- have been presented in the best way possible.

6 December 2020,"I loved the golden compass movie, the premise..., the storyline...., everything. So when I tried the first episode and it reminded me of it I was really intrigued and happy that I get more of its world. The cgi alone and the animals is brilliantly done. The actors and actresses, locations, dialogue and script are all excellent and make for a very good show. I have to got to hand it to the actress for playing lyra so well. That she has got me staying on this show! I had to wait until it had finished all the episodes because I would have been annoyed waiting a whole week to see what happens next, like I am with this season 2 T.T .

The scenery and atmosphere is beautiful.
It's obvious they have spent alot of time and money to bring this to life and I wish everyone would stop being so negative for no good reason.

10 August 2020,"I just completed the first season and was absolutely amazed. The cinematography is just as stunning and better detailed, though perhaps not quite to the scale, as Game of Thrones.
The Gorgeous atmosphere of this tale could've been taken directly from my backdrop of my own mind. It involves an elaborate conglomeration of steam punk, art deco, turn-of-the-century, and Edison-bulb lighting style. It's captures the romantic elegance of simpler times and wraps it in a boundless, angst conjuring fantasy world.
Just when when the tangible elements in the film seem to peak, then the glorious enigma of the Northern Lights shine upon the whole scene. The powers-that-be could not have made a more fantastic tale unless they sprinkled its entire universe with witches, magic, and fairy dust.
But wait...
They did that, too.",10/10

4 January 2020,"I really looked forward to this, and there were definitely things I enjoyed about the series - Lyra's personality, the interactions with the daemons, and the style of production. I was disappointed when a lot happened in the final few episodes only to leave so many things unresolved. Yes I appreciate that this is part one, but my hope was that it would resolve itself somehow, while leaving room for future series. I have not read the books so I'm ignorant of what's to come, but I don't think that should leave me with so many unanswered questions.This may be great in a few years when they've added more series, but in isolation, this left me frustrated. I'm not saying don't watch it, but manage your expectations beforehand.",7/10
10 December 2019,"It is a spectacular story, I like the bigger attention to the storyline's detail. The true themes and issues of the book (like religion, morals and obligation) show in this adaption and are not seeming superficial like in the first movie. Great cinematography and music, I must say.Yet... oddly I miss som aspects of the old version, this adaptation has odd casting choices, and misses some key character traits. There is just not as much grand and Hollywood about it... it's about the visual/animation, of how BBC portray the characters and the grand scenes. It's just not enough when you know how magical it could be.(Also, something that irritates me is the fact that the demons are almost only noticeable concerning the main characters. Like all other demons are just simply hiding or busy being bugs.)",6/10
4 January 2021,"This show does not get enough attention! I'm a fan of the book series, and was thrilled to hear BBC/HBO was doing a tv show adaptation. I counted down the weeks to the season 1 premiere, and was at once blown away during the first episode simply by the feeling it conveyed-it felt exactly like the feeling the books were going for. This is, without a doubt, influenced by the spectacular soundtrack!While the acting was a little shaky at first, it quickly solidified itself by powerful performances from Dafne Keen and Ruth Wilson. The storytelling was also a bit awkward in the first season, and elements were missed that could've easily been corrected to make it more true to the events of the books.One thing that really bugged me was the lack of daemons with many background characters. Some can be less visible since we can assume they take the form of a small creature like a beetle or something easily hidden like a mouse or a snake. But you can't really make that excuse when you see CROWDS of people, and you often do. Also, real dogs were sometimes used as daemons and it was quite off-putting, since daemons like Pan are CGI'd, and the difference between a real dog and a CGI dog is extremely obvious. I get that it saved on the visual effects budget, but it would've been better to do that for background characters' daemons, not characters we see quite plainly on the screen.I also disliked some of the pacing with season one-it focused a bit too much on the Gyptians, which forced the last few episodes to feel rushed with Iorek's storyline.Despite these things, I did thoroughly enjoy the first season! It captured the essence of the original book far better than the movie, and the acting was superb, with standout performances from Ruth Wilson, Amir Wilson, and Dafne Keen especially. I was overjoyed when Will was introduced earlier, as he's my favorite character from the books!I was cautiously optimistic when season 2 premiered, as I was a bit worried how it would be carried out since The Subtle Knife is my favorite book in the series. However, I needn't have worried. Season 2 met and exceeded my expectations!The producers seemed to have listened to feedback about the lack of daemons, because the first thing I noticed was that daemons were far more visible than they were before. I especially liked seeing the daemons of those in the Magisterium, and even seeing them talk to their person was fascinating to me. The CGI for the daemons was also much better than last season!I do not have a single complaint about how the storyline was carried out in this season! It was absolutely perfect, and exactly how I imagined it. As far as I know, there aren't any significant things that were missed in translation from book to movie, and I especially appreciated how they retained Lyra's strong personality. Lyra's personality faltered in the book after she got closer to Will, and I didn't really like that. I thought the show did a way better job of accurately portraying her personality.And can I just say I love Amir Wilson? He does not get enough love in this show! I will sing Ruth Wilson's praises like everyone else, but Amir is the PERFECT Will, and his performance is absolutely fantastic!If you didn't love the vibe of Season 1, or didn't feel like Season 2 might be worth watching after Season 1, I would highly encourage you to watch Season 2! It picks up on the main plot of the series magnificently, and the themes of spirituality, religion, morality, etc are highlighted often, and it's absolutely fascinating. The story itself also picks up quite a bit, and the action scenes are great!I cannot wait for Season 3!",8/10
9 November 2019,"Having expressed my disappointment let me say that I am going to watch it again as I was distracted somewhat the first go around. The production values are as one expects from BBC/HBO projects. I'm on the fence over the casting. The Asriel character is sort of OK, Lyra I found a little too mature, and Mrs. Coulter fits the books description in appearance as well as being devious and misguided. As someone else mentioned the pacing of the first installment is too quick. They have covered a lot of territory in a short time and left out detail necessary for under standing the story and characters. I know the movie did the whole first book in 2 hours but there was enough time spent early on setting the stage either visually or verbally such that some compression later on did not hurt. The books are full of detail as the books always are and of course films can never compete on that level or have ever separate character on screen.
I am quite familiar with the books and yet I felt a bit lost by the time the credits appeared. The screen writers obviously thought the book's dialogue was not adequate as some of it was quite divergent. The opening episode should have been 2 hours to set the stage and draw in the audience. Perhaps the budget is constraining or they have taken a position on the storyline in order to attract a wider audience.
I am glad someone has decided to do this project as I felt the movie was worth watching and was disappointed when the Puritans out there brought enough pressure to bear to scare away production interest in sequels.",6/10
23 December 2019,"Disclaimer: I have worked for two decades as a film and TV reviewer, and will say it now, that Fantasy isn't my favourite genre. But I know a good piece of drama when I see it.Like Harry Potter before it, I had not read the books, but thought I'd give the big visual production version a go. And though I would say that this was not execrable, as were the HP films, this did not work. The production values were grand, but they did not paper over the cracks in the narrative. We, the new audience, not previously educated by the books, had no idea what compelled the action, and the writers either could not, or would not, bend to this most basic consideration of story telling. I got the idea that I was watching the edited highlights of the best bits from the books; something that was merely adulatory made to indulge already signed up fans.As a consequence I have no desire to know what happens next. And there can be no harsher condemnation of an adventure thriller, poised on the precipice of part II, than that.",3/10
19 December 2019,I was looking forward to this series. In episode one I considered to stop watching it as the way the actors are speaking is so over the top. Only with some epic music under every dialogue can they get away with it. After eprisode six I can say that the story seems a bit flat like every episode is a story on its own. It's not that bad. I'd still watch the season. I somehow expected more from it.,6/10

4 January 2021,"All of the actors are fine and graphics are good but the storyline is too stupid to be enjoyable in any way.We got witches who are supposed to be powerful or whatever and those are getting dropped like flies by humans. (Like most of the other characters) They often act very irrational like for example if youre on recon mission in the town why would you bring your flying fragile bird daemon with you inside the building? For it to get killed easily by ground daemon? Or the other one who who was supposed to protect Lyra instead she just went to sleep and slept so good she didn't even woke up for Lyra's ubdaction and was killed sleeping. What kind of characters are those?Also. Will's father. He was that mystery man since season one, we got his head in first episode, then we know that he's not dead, then we learn about his family and story a bit, then we spend season and a half looking for him with Will and Lyra, then one of the most charismatic characters that we loved and cared about since the first season sacrifices himself for this guy to get to his son and protect Lyra and stuff and then... And then this guy gets killed by some generic noname soldier in the very next scene he's in. Excuse me what?Also. Why waste our time with plotlines that dont go nowhere? Why did Serafina give Lee her amulet so he can summon here only for him to forget about it and then using it when he's already basically dead so Serafina dont save him anywhay? Was this all only for her to be away from Lyra at the time of abduction? So much time wasted and kind of makes you think if Lee didn't summon her would Lyra even be kidnapped? No? Maybe? Kind of ruins his death a bit for me if it wasn't stupid and pointless enough already.Black guy's (Forgot his name, sorry. Guy in the suit with the snake) death was the stupidiest one, I'm sorry. He was fine to watch and fun on screen but then he gets killed by mrs Caulter for some reason and all of his motivations and actions on screen didn't lead to basically anything. Why did we even need him?How does mrs Caulter control that village demons again? Did I missed something?One of the worst things are the villains. Mrs Caulter is fine, I think the actress is cool though I'd think character was supposed to be charming on the surface and not repulsive (not in the appearance way, in the mean moody lady way) at the first sight but whatever. The whole Magisterium organisation is so stupid I can't even take them seriously. They are so cliche, such a caricature and so brainded most of the time I roll my eyes every time they're on screen. I mean we get it dude you hate the church so you made a book about church oppressing scientists and overall progress of humanity and made Vatican its main villain but come on. We're not in the Middle ages anymore and people dont give one damn about Catholic church dude. The ony people who take the church kind of seriously now are people who are actually involved with it in some way. Other people are mocking it and stuff all the time and youre making Catholic church the main villains?There are millions more plotholes and bad character design examples I can provide but I won't. Just believe me dudes the second season is not good and I won't be watching the third one. Again, I cosider all of the actors good if only I would enjoy Will more if he didnt have the long face all of time but that's nitpicking. Sorry for my English, not my main language. Cheers.",2/10

Also Ruth Wilson from Luther is an excellent touch.There's some less than amazing acting, though I usually expect that from a new show.

..for people that want a quick summary to see if it will interest them/who are unsure based on the first episode...I'll try not to but plot twist spoilers!!The deamon (demon) animal that they all have is like a soul, but visable. It's not an evil demon, it's a thing every human in the world of the first episode is born with. It's their soul.There are many worlds, not just the one we see to start with.(The first book, so I assume the first series is set in lyra world, with just glimpses of another world..this is a large part of book one discovering the first ""other world""...the other two books jump around worlds a lot..)We get to see many other worlds, including our own. All differ (no deamons/demons in our world..they are hidden within us ..our soul)...tiny human like creatures . Cow/elephant type creatures with a diamond type skeleton. A world with soul eating creaturesLyra and the other main character (from our world)later on are able to travel between worldsThere's also a land of the dead, harpies, Angels and a fortress kingdomEven though it seems like magic, it has a strong scientific vein running through it to explain things logically.As seen in ""our world"" when our scientists are using computers to investigate ""dust /dark mater""The worlds although very different, all have a major link connecting them.This is the source of much investigation and myth in all worlds, and is why Lyra is so important.",10/10

21 November 2019,"Many other reviewers perfectly sum up my own take on this disappointing adaptation of the beloved trilogy by Phillip Pullman. The first episode was an adjustment from the movie - which I was quite happy with at its debut - so I tried to reserve my judgements. The casting choices are a bit of a palate change from the movie, but one can get over them with great writing and supportive cinematography.Unfortunately, I've since lost hope of improvement after watching the third episode tonight. What should be a gripping and colorful telling of this alternate universe and its people falls flat in virtually every aspect.Overall the plot is meandering and boring most of the time, even as they rush through key character and plot development points that require more finesse and detail. Characters are unimaginative and uninteresting - and also notably without their interactive daemons most of the time (who, aside from Pan, don't speak or interact with their people except when beaten or killed?)I don't understand the many inexplicable and senseless deviations from the original story (which as yet serve no evident purpose). I understand changes must be made for the screen, but unnecessary additions are made to the script, while necessary details simply dropped. Key revelations are exposed with no build up, and lack the dramatic impact they have in the books, as well as 2007 adaptation of the Golden Compass.Simply put: it's a poor adaptation of the books if you've read them or even seen the movie. Otherwise enjoy the show.",4/10
24 November 2019,This series thus far is quite interesting and engaging. The actors are versatile and have immersed themselves in the characters they play. The movie of course has many differences compared with the series. Of course no one can come close to the riveting performance of the grear Nicole Kidman but the actress is doing a good job thus far. I recommend this series as it has a dark lure and grabs the attention of the viewer to the very end.,8/10
26 November 2019,"I literally only created an account so I can leave a review for this atrocity they dare to call an adaptation. Not that any of the haters of this comment will read further but I would like to provide some context for my feelings and opinions:
This book series and world is absolutely the most beloved-to-me world ever created. I was barely 11 when The Golden Compass book released in America and I was gifted it the day it released; a very kind school librarian who may have saved my life by doing so.
I was abused daily in many ways and this world was my escape. I would hide in closets and crawl spaces- wherever I would fit- and read this book cover to cover; and start at the beginning again after reading the last word. To this day I still read every book, including other related works released by P.P., AT LEAST once a month. I may not be in the traumatic childhood I was trapped in, but they still bring me so much comfort!
My vivid imagination was never enough to indulge the deepest desires to see this world come to screen. The news of a film excited me more than anything and I knew I would do my best to be forgiving of limitations that would most definitely arise in any valiant attempt to bring this world to life. When the film released I actually left the cinema sobbing with a broken heart and barely 1/4 of the way through the treacherous film! Hearing that BBC was trying their best to bring this production to life I was ecstatic due to their past works and my enjoyment of them. I have waited so long for things to finally fall into place only to be consumed with hatred and despair: this is a nightmare of a show.
I am absolutely shocked at how horrible it is turning out and I've tried with each new episode to evolve with their slaughter of such sacred words. It was never a good sign that P.P. supported the film and to this day makes excuses for the production. He seems absolutely thrilled with this series and I can't for the life of me figure out why.
The casting and direction is so wildly inappropriate that if names weren't used so frequently I would truly question what I was actually watching. The personalities of each character is either so greatly flawed that the character is unrecognizable in all but name or diluted just enough to enrage me because I've connected the possible threads to the new Book of Dust trilogy in the works which in and of itself is incredibly ridiculous and confusing to me because the changed character traits are a direct effect AFTER HDM traumas and events!
Unfortunately P.P. did such an incredible job with his characters' developments, plots, and sheer originality of universe, that it may be impossible to ever do it justice in any medium with any budget.
Because Harry Potter keeps getting brought up- I feel that those adaptations were not as well done as they could have been. I still get angry when I re read the books and remember what should have translated to film so well and was cut or blatantly ignored- AND YET(!!!!!!) they are beloved films to me and because I could feel the respect and effort to the canon material. I can appreciate creative license and the need to make changes for better transitions from page to screen- this is not that!
The splicing of time lines and mixing up of characters/dæmons that people are constantly claiming to be confused by (understandably so!). There's just so much wrong with this series that I am exhausted by trying to articulate it all in a review.
I'm very confused by the fans who are enjoying this and the explanations they give- great for them and the support they are giving the artists, but this work is such a disservice to the world that means everything to me. Maybe sometime in my lifetime someone can give our world the gift of all the worlds that are squished between each page of HDM.",1/10
3 December 2019,"Given the frustration of The Golden Compass being an incomplete movie, I was excited to see another attempt at the source material with this TV series. But after several episodes I still find myself preferring the movie. Now I'll admit this is an unfair starting comparison. There are three major problems I have with the series so far.The first is Lyra's complete lack of personality. Book Lyra is a nearly uncontrollable adventurer and liar/storyteller, the latter of which is a crucial element to her personality that proves decisive throughout the story and her later growth as a person. Yet Dafne Keen's Lyra is simply missing that part of the character! The show may be following the original story reasonably closely for now, but major deviations in both story and character personalities will be required further down the road unless the producers are counting on viewers already knowing what will happen.The second problem is that the daemons are conspicuously absent for all but the main characters, and even then only Pantalaimon and, to a lesser extent, Hester and the Golden Monkey, are really given any screen time. This is problematic because daemons are extensions of every person in the universe; cutting them out quite literally reduces a character to nothing. Like Lyra's missing personality, daemons are crucial to the story and cannot be ignored.Finally, the show is just so slooooow. The first two books in the series are not long books and don't dawdle at any particular event. I think 8 episodes is too many to cover the first book. Perhaps the first book would have been better suited for 5, maybe 6 episodes.Or better yet, a 2 1/2 hour movie! Which is what we nearly got over a decade ago until New Line Cinema panicked when they realized they weren't getting the movie that they expected and then chopped off the ending and (somewhat clumsily) rearranged the remainder of the second half. If they ever were to release the original version of the movie, I think I know which adaptation I'd prefer.That all being said, the series is still well-designed, if perhaps a different vision of the world from the books and the film, with a solid score and visuals (minus the missing daemons). I question the drawing of material from outside the first book, but am willing to go with it. The early scenes involving Will also look promising for his character.",5/10
7 December 2019,"I have never wrote a review about anything but this is one of the best series i have ever watched in my life 👍. I mean the storyline, the plots, even the intro. Is lit 🔥🔥
Thanx so much for this life changing series😁",10/10
7 December 2019,"I really enjoyed the books......alot.....i read the series and all the adjoining books (except book of dust) 7 times each.......by far my favourite thing ever.......I am so happy that this series is being made.........with that said i kept many things in mind when i rated this work. Bear in mind that i am only up to episode 5 at the time of this review.....I shall bring my complaints about the show first.......the main one SPOILER SPOILER they killed off Billy AGAIN he wasnt supposed to die :( it was supposed to be tony makarios who was supposed to die but he was supposed to die with no one but lyra by his side because the gyptians were supposed to be afraid of him and Lyra was supposed to carve Ratters (they got the name right atleast) name into a coin she had from a stranger she met while running away from mrs coulters in london......that bugged me alot, also i feel like alot of the characters are portrayed really well but there are times i feel that a few characters dont fit that well.........with that said......... I LOVE THE SHOW LMFAO like its very entertaining and it gives some incite into areas the book didnt touch much on i have to say i imagined will differently but i think he's growing on me quickly I love the envisioning of the Alethiometer I want to buy one please HBO if you see this make it a purchasable prop!!! also loved the CLiffHangar on episode 5 holysheet
so far the show seems to be doing justice to the crazyness that was the Golden compass movie.....what a travesty that was.,.......anyways excited for the rest",8/10
16 December 2019,"After Lyra & her daemon survived the fall from the balloon I stopped watching it.
Reason 1. There was no indication that the balloon was flying low.Even though before the fall they acted like a fall would be fatal.
Reason 2 . They were going some place to rescue her father ,after she falls down surprisingly they were near that location.If they were reached their destination before she fell down the pilot should have known that right ?
Reason 3. She fell down on the hard ice surface in her front side down but beside being alive and break something she is not even bleeding.Also she missed the hills while falling down which looks like was 1-2 meters away ?
The story has so many flaws it's just unimaginable.Probably wrote for the kids or wrote by a kid who is beyond any real logic.Also this should have a fantasy tag on the genre .
If you are a regular adult with real life logic keep away from this nonsense no matter what the fake rating say.
I would still give it a 6 for good cinematography and animation .",6/10
17 December 2019,"Of course I have some questions. Ep. 1 A helicopter???????? An ordinary 'copter? Really shook me up. CGI budget ran out I guess. But I recovered. The baby's daemon really should have poked his head out. Seriously, I have read the books multiple times and this is great so far. I wonder what will happen to Will's mom. And I am looking forward to the BIG ASRIEL REVELATION. The book actually went wrong in my opinion. No idea how they will fix it. If. They already improved some things on the books.Ms. C. is sooo complex and menacing: love it.Dafne is fine. They must have had to hurry up filming before her daemon settled. Oh wait, wrong world.",10/10

The bear fight. Imagine, if you will, two bears fighting to the death. That's literally what you have to do. How did the Golden Compass (movie) do this better? Stop trimming the fat and losing the flavor, lest the entire population think everything's supposed to taste like crap.

22 December 2019,"Watched the whole series now, and can honestly say I wish I'd made better use of 8 HOURS of my life! Its consistently dull and slow paced. It spends too long on certain scenes and then rushes through the magical scenes e.g. the dual of the bears. Almost as if they had a limited CGI budget. Certain character arcs are patchy and not fleshed out well.Altogether I'd say it was on par with the Golden Compass. Very disappointed given it was a BBC/HBO collaboration, I had high hopes.",4/10
26 November 2020,I love this show! The creators are really doing an impressive work with this tv shows. The way that the are telling the story of Lyra is just amazing. The graphics (the daemons) are impressive as well. I really like this show and I hope HBO gives us 10 seasons.,10/10
30 December 2019,"This show suffers from the DC syndrome and is barely bearable.I did not enjoy the forced dark theme of it compared to the original novels and was very disappointed by the shallowness of main character Lyra.
These Hollywood folk are always whining about ""strong female Character"" but when they are provided with a well written strong female. they somehow always manage to ruin her. Lyra in the books is 'clever' and resourceful. She is 'in the moment' kind of person. Yes, she was sad about roger but she would never appear weak or helpless.
The show just makes her obsess about roger and nothing else matters. These elites can't seem to imagine a young girl thinking about anything other than a boy. They can't let her have some fun by herself.I'm so done with this trash of a show.",2/10
2 January 2020,"I haven't read the books or watched the film with Nicole Kidman ( the film with the funny kiddo cover). However, I find the TV series thrilling, unpredictable;the plot is connected to some of the mysteries of the world. It's a deep thing. There are many legends about CENSURE (wouldn't say it ,because it would be a SPOILER for SEASON 1) where Nazis and Russians were looking for some power in it and it's source .
The acting is great!
Actually, I haven't watched TV series since GOT, but this caught me! Last night, on HBO I started watching In His Dark Materials for the first time and ended up at 5 am looking for info about it. I watched the full first season for one night!
It is so good that now I'm planning to read the books by this author.
( In many reviews Harry Potter is mentioned. BUT, I can't stand watching HP for more than 2 minutes. So, please do not compare these two. It is ridiculous! Some kiddo film vs this stunning fantasy!",10/10

14 February 2020,"A big fat bla for this one. I liked the books, as I read them I felt absorbed in the world and connected with the characters. The series unfortunately captures none of it, it's flat and dull and I just cannot get behind the cast at all. Mrs Coulter was beautiful and electric, nope, more like a weird creepy aunt with a mouth like the Dr in a nightmare before christmas. Ma Costa was a big mama gypsy, nope, a little blonde. Lord Fa an intimidating boss dude, nope. Lord Asriel tall, fierce, handsome, nope, as much as I like James Macavoy, he hasn't got it. Lyra brunette, stubborn, smart, naive, manipulative as sin, nope, boring and unlikeable. A flashy Spanishy looking bloke for the rangy texan Lee? A black will? Civilised, posh Iorek? Meh. The cgi for the cities and the daemons is poor. Woke woke woke diversity forced in. Strange changes. Everything is very slow and dragged out. Where are the daemons? Can't seem to decide on the level or style of modern tech they are going for in Lyra's world. There's just nothing going on to keep your interest, it feels a bit like a budget, lazy Harry Potter spin off...",1/10
18 August 2021,"Again, strangely IMDB has a mix of people giving it 9 or 10 out of 10 and others giving it 1-4 stars.I am the latter. Lots of the acting is terrible, perhaps. Some. Of. The. Screenplay. Is at fault (ie - really odd gaps between characters statements), really clunky language, comical and delayed overacting (lots of odd screaming from Mrs Coulter). Took all of the energy and thrill out of the bear fight (they removed their armour for the battle - that makes sense, right ?) and hid the finale of that fight too.Another example of diversity quotas casting, which isn't really that important, if they had managed to get good actors (though even great actors appearign in this come across really badly - I haven't seen James McAvoy anywhere near as unconvincing in anything else he has done).Only continuing to watch in the diminishing hope tha tthey actually capture some of the big picture messages - but the scale and CGI shortcuts, as well as the script and acting makes that very unlikely.....",2/10
6 June 2020,"James McAvoy is in 2 episodes. In the previews they have him as a lead, yet he may as well be wallpaper. It's like the show producers go to tremendous lengths to keep face time of actors on par with the actual amount of money that was on the budget. Netflix does this with every production and it's horribly noticable. The description of the show is inaccurate. The violence level is much higher than they suggest in the description of the show. If they were going to present it like that, they should have just made a 3 hour film per book instead of a 8 hour porta potty fest of a season!",1/10
10 June 2020,"I really was excited for this as someone I knew who also loved the books recommend ed it to me. At first it was really cool, and the fuzzy not very well remembered images from childhood came to life for a while for me. As amazing as an experience that was...it was fleeting and I was left with a slightly above average somewhat patronisingly middle class box set from the BBC with some added whistles and bells. ( I find it ironic that they're sorta being a bit classist in their own way whilst try to appear incredibly sanitised and PC)It's okay, better than the film, so watch it if you liked the books I guess. Obviously I'm aware that when adapting stuff for TV and cinema you have to take curtain liberties, and still sometimes the result isn't the best. Something that comes to mind is hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, the creator of the book never want a film because the first chapter involved the destruction of the earth, which he felt could never be realistically created and it's impact never truly felt through cinema like it was in the book. This is the same thing. Except with the weirdly manipulative trend I've seen recently all over cinema and tv of the nostalgia fest to hide the flaws.A lot of people have been saying if you haven't read the book you might not enjoy it as much, and I totally agree with that sentiment, this film isn't really for new time viewers, it's for those who read the books and really enjoyed the magic of it all.I would say that's so corrupt and wrong how they're making money of the fans, but every remake or adaptation that is big enough is done for that reason to some degree, it happens so much I'm left feeling cold and disappointed rather than angry and outraged.",6/10
6 April 2020,"Having not known this universe from before, I found the theme with daemons intriging and the world interesting. The quality of acting, animation and special effects and music is really good. With that being said, the storyline is really thin, and very little happens honestly. The whole series could have been put into one or two movies. I found myself skipping 10 seconds ahead constantly while watching, beause of the drawn out scenes, where very little new information is added. Especially the whole part with the boy with his sick mum. The series is very predicatble, and I really hope next season will bring more and at a slightly higher pacing.Watching this show as an adult is sure not going to give you much, probably more enjoyable as a kid. Quality is high, but the story compared to it being 8 episodes, is really thin.",7/10
22 August 2020,"When I first started reading His Dark Materials novels, book one captivated me with the notion of Daemons, the idea of having an emotionally intelligent outward physical element of yourself is beyond genius, the variation between the children's and adult's Daemons was more than plenty to get me curious about the world mechanics. But then in the motion series Daemons are hugely neglected, they barely interact with their humans, for most parts of the series they one say a few lines like it is a forced dialogue. The whole Daemon idea was having your soul physically present and to neglect those interactions was just simply atrocious and upsetting.Transforming books into motion is difficult and alterations are expected but what they did was majorly disregard the source material, they simply got the generally story line and redesigned the moments they thought needed to get into the episodes. Most of the enchanting moments in the book have been remodeled to points where you watch them and all you can say is that was anticlimactic and far from the what really happened. Alterations are okay if they add more depth to the original scene.The story pace was just plain right random, the switching between worlds was just bad. It was just disturbing and took away from the mystery of the story the novels strived so hard to indulge the readers in, the order in which everything was revealed created a lingering desire for the next scene in the story. The idea of another world was supposed to be a myth until the final episodes when Lord Asriel created the window to another world but no you get that in episode two with no apparent connection to the Lyra throughout the whole series. They kept on showing us all these segments of the book just so we know they are there but they did nothing to the sorry other than make minutes in the episodes.But with that aside they did wonders with the visuals, was a huge upgrade on the Golden Compass movie, they did not dial down on the seriousness or sensitivity of what the novel was trying to put across and there choice of characters was excellent, regardless of the flaws, it was so easy to relate to them, Lyra especially.",5/10

The reason I liked the story is every new episode has something I don't expect, and when I do expect it it doesn't happen exactly the way you expect. The concept of Daemons I liked but the whole concept of pantheism and consciousness of everything not really. My favorite characters were Lyra, always adventurous, and Marisa Coulter who is very enigmatic. Most of all I liked Lee Scoresby, also very adventurous but he does it in a different way.

I admit the first book (season 1) can be difficult to get into. The second book (season 2) is where the story stats to make sense and compliments the first book! The third book (hopefully season 3) compliments the first 2 and ties everything together.

Unfortunately, this adaptation has no sense of adventure and no joy. **SPOILERS** The Lyra portrayed in HBO's HDM is more like the melancholy adult Lyra of The Secret Commonwealth, and not the boisterous, insolent girl who travels to the North on her own, befriends an armored bear, and convincingly spins wild tales. Also, I don't understand the choice to collapse books 1 & 2 but then also add much that was not in the books. It's like the writers try to infuse every scene with a sense of foreboding and that just isn't the spirit of this story.",6/10

But however much I wanted to like it, not once at most episode it felt totally random and not compelling - just some loosely attached sequence of events, unclearly justified actions, placeholder dialogues. This a bit bland plotsetting could have been saved by acting, but... Say what you will about the Golden Compass movie, but their cast was absolutely superb - Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig felt exactly right, each with clear character and distinguishable traits. In HDM series on the contrast I could not name a single remarkable role - some were ok like Lyra, some witches, the scientist, and some were just bad or - in the case of Mrs. Coulter - very bad. Ruth Wilson is undoubtedly talented actress, but this is just not the role for her, sorry.

Personally I would suggest reading the books first because there's a lot of details that remain confusing during the first two seasons due the time constraints. It's a shame they decided not to continue filming the Asriel episode as it wasn't written into the book and could have been quite fascinating. Whilst the movie has some better special effects and technology the series maintains a high quality I suspect because of it being a HBO project and not just BBC.

But unfortunately I'm not overjoyed by the first episode. There are too many details that are a bit off. The acting is fine but the casting is not as I expected. The age and appearance of almost every main character is wrong, at least to me and the way I imagined them (and the way they are described in the books).I'm aware of when making a movie (or series) from a book you have to cut some corners but you shouldn't t change such essential parts.Hopefully they will stay true to the story henceforth, I will keep watching, not expect too much and it will probably grow on me.",6/10
25 November 2019,"As a huge fan of the books my expectations were sky high and I really haven't been disappointed.
Page and screen are such different media there is no way one can adapt to the other without making certain changes to make it work. For me the changes for this, expanding certain plotlines and introducing some concepts earlier, slightly changing and expanding the roles of some characters has really worked and served the adaptation and storytelling well.
The pace has been of a confident slow build, really inhabiting the world and has eskewed adding unnecessary axtra action sequences to satisfy the more impatient.
Genuine family entertainment that rewards attention and patience, I can't imagine a better adaptation without tripling the production budget, though they may need that by season 3.",10/10
3 November 2019,"As with any new series the first episodes are often choc full of exposition. HDM is no exception and whizzes through the first episode with some on the nose dialogue and the intent to get the ball rolling quickly.The CGI daemons were good, some casting choices well made and all the right boxes were ticked to establish themes of the series and get you asking the right questions but my praise ends there, not to say I disliked it but I have concerns that, in a pilot for a popular fantasy epic book to TV adaption, I shouldn't have.The direction is my first criticism. There's a lot of use of handheld cameras which makes it feel more low budget than immersive and some camera shots especially in dialogue sequences could've been constructed better. The writing probably takes a lot of inspiration from the books but a lot of it feels hurried and doesn't give us a lot of time establishing characters before thrusting them forward into the story.The music felt lacking and forgettable and seemed like it was played in the background simply to cover for moments of silence instead of playing for any discernible reason. A show like this could benefit with the use of leitmotifs for certain characters, particularly Lyra, Azriel and Coulter but hopefully something picks up throughout the series as the introduction theme certainly tries something.Some side characters also felt like they really lacked charisma, something that stands out when acting next to the likes of McAvoy. Whether it's down to the directing again, the writing or just the acting is hard to tell but it feels like any other average BBC show so far.Between this episode and the ""Next Time"" segment not a lot has been left to be unexpected, that is to say if you don't want the rest of the season spoiled avoid the ""Next Time"" altogether as it doesn't seem to know what to hold back. This says to me the creators aren't confident people will stick around without it and I can understand why.Overall a disappointing and underwhelming start but hopefully the series finds its footing in the coming weeks.",4/10
4 January 2021,"Even as a non-reader I know that this is a bad adaptation. Yes, great animation, interesting world, but bad acting, bad casting. And what the hell is even happening? What does everyone do? Who are they? Why are they doing what they do? Nothing is explained. Is that series only for the readers? Because I got bored so fast that it doesn't make you want to read the books. Nice try, too pretentious and condescending.",2/10
2 November 2020,"Who am I, well I red the books, when I was a young girl and this summer when I completely binge red the series again after reading the first part of the book of dust series. I was a big fan when I was 14 and still am. I am not, however, a big fan of the movie. Funny, because in looks the movie is closer to my imagination. The cast of his dark materials however fits so much better.Lyra actually is the stubborn, clueless but brave girl she supposed to be. Her father and mother a combination of good but oh so bad. They try. I've red some reviews about the commander, I am sorry, father coram to be better cast as lord Faa. I don't agree, lord Faa should be a strong leader, active, viable, not a reminder of what he one once was.I also red about people disagreeing with coloured people playing parts which supposed to represent white supremacy. What white supremacy, it is not in the books? And isn't this the great part, it is another world. Why wouldn't it be possible for there to be less focus on a distinction between black and white.The Harry Potter comparison, and that is a weak rip off, just no. Don't get me wrong, my childhood was Harry Potter. But I do, honestly, find the golden compass series smarter and deeper layered. It is fantasy but at a level, which is not that far from reality, although it is.The series is a great adaptation, close to the story and I am looking forward to the second season.One point of criticism, the fight between Iorek and Iofur, why aren't they wearing their uniform!",9/10
9 November 2019,"I have read the books and have the film on DVD (which I thought quite good). Whilst I was disappointed when it became obvious that books 2/3 would not be filmed, I was not surprised. When it was announced that all 3 books would be used to create a mini series I thought great, about time. After the first episode I wonder if the books are actually too difficult to film properly. At least that is the impression I get with this HBO/BBC offering.",5/10

13 February 2020,I love these novels so much! The movie was unwatchable but I'm sure it's the best adaptation! I love the 1st season and can't wait to watch all seasons),10/10
24 November 2019,The thing I like about a tv show they can put more detail in an hour vs a movie has to be quick and to the point in the book it takes awhile until the Stories of the North come to a start. Good job HBO,10/10
4 February 2021,I'm afraid that it only really works for people who have already read the books.,5/10
12 December 2019,"I'd say any hype around this series is based purely on the fact that more of the book's content is going to be shown (versus the film) and not about the acting or the portrayal of the ideas in the book (e.g. the intimacy of human-dæmon bond).Visually it's quite good, and it's nice they're able to show parts of the book that a film wouldn't be able to, but I've found there's something lacking in this series. The acting is a little bit stale and it fails to draw you in and keep you invested. It's just not as gripping as the book. There's also a big verbal emphasis on the significance of dæmons but it isn't physically shown, i.e. there's almost no affection shown between (in particular) the kids and their dæmons, which means the relationship Mrs. Coulter has with her dæmon is shown as less significant than it should be.",6/10
3 June 2021,While the story drags on when Jamie Childs directs the show comes alive with Leanne Welham takes over. I have no doubt Childs has talent it's just the way some of the scenes drag waayyyyyy too long. Especially in the begining when the story would switch to Will's world. Each scene just seem to take too long to play out. It made me feel like they were just killing time thus making it more boreing than suspenseful. Other than that direction the show and actors truly come out in little pieces to wonder and delight. In regards to the story I'm wondering if the characters have intermittent memory lapse and an inability to rely on general logic to solve many of the miscommunications that occur in dialog. Overall this is a good series and I hope it continues as I think it has great potential. Perhaps getting another writer's perspective.,7/10
1 December 2020,"Season 1 is ok, but season 2 is so much better. The cast in this series is brilliant. I love the relationship of Lyra and Will that play by Dafnee Keen and Amir Wilson. Can't wait for the next episode.",9/10
12 November 2019,"I'm only two episodes in, but so far it is The adaptation this series deserves. The actors are phenomenal, and Daphne Keen is impressive. A girl of 13/14 years old delivers a acting feat that is Oscar worthy.",9/10

30 December 2020,"The show is awesome. I binged both seasons. Being upset back in 2007 that the trilogy was never made, this made me happy. Those who read the books and are complaining, shut your face. If you don't want to be disappointed, don't read the books. Same goes with Harry Potter, Witcher, LOTR and Hobbit. Stop crying already. It's a awesome show.",10/10
4 November 2019,"I absolutely loved the first episode. Though it is a bit early to say, but this show has some real promise. Acting was good, the CGI's were top notch. Yep, It's a 10 out of 10 start for me.",10/10
8 December 2019,"I've never done a review on IMDb before but just have to for this. Anyone who enjoys fantasy books will have read HDM and were probably disappointed by the golden compass movie. This series however is fantastic! It depicts the books so well and really is like my imagination coming to life, I just wish I could binge watch it rather than waiting every week! Ruth Wilson as Mrs Coulter is incredible.",10/10
8 November 2019,"I wanted to like this. I really did. This book series has been my favorite for a long time, having read through the series three times now. And while I criticized the Golden Compass movie adaptation years ago, I now oddly miss it, for all it's shortcomings. What this adaptation does is assume that it's audience is stupid and unimaginative. Unlike the books where we get to experience the world that is so like ours but so very different through Lyra's eyes, we're told immediately right off the bat in text that that's the case. This first episode should be held as a shining example of how to ""tell, not show"". The amount of overblown exposition and lack of any emotional connection to the characters is staggering. The pacing is incredibly fast... I felt like they covered FAR too much in the first episode for you to get any meaningful sense of the world and Lyra. Unlike the books where you uncover the tension and plot along with Lyra, the plot is thrown at you through arguably trite performances. I felt like few actors had any subtly, and honestly I never thought I would yearn for Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig back. While Dafne Keen looks the part in my minds eye far more than her predecessor, she's given little to do and some fairly uneven and obnoxious dialogue. The CGI daemons are beautiful at times but also somewhat unsuccessful. The smaller pole cats and ermine's feel believable enough but Azriel's snow leopard lacks any of the weight and presence that the movie version had years ago.I'm curious to see where this goes, and while I'm glad to see this story get screen time once again, I hardly think that this is the adaptation this book deserves. I admit the book is a glorious spider's web of chaos and complexity, but there is still a spark amidst all of it, and a passion that shines through. I get none of that from this show. The editing, cinematography and color grading all scream BBC. And I don't mean that in a good way. Everything just feels mildly pedestrian. The movie at least succeeded at having a cohesive point of view in its art direction, the art direction here seems a bit all over the place with little real point of view.Maybe the book is unadaptable. I don't know. But I knew I was in for a bumpy ride when I had the world described to me in four sentences before I ever even set foot in it.Maybe in another ten years we'll figure it out.",5/10
5 December 2019,I had read all of Pullmans HDM books and love them with a passion. this show is Incredible and as a book reader i'm still on the edge of my seat every week watching the show. Not only have they keep the Spirit of the book but they has also expanded on the source material. 10/10,10/10
19 April 2020,I waited a long time for a sequel of The Golden Compass movie but it never did happen. This is amazing it must be completed till end I want to watch this in visualized version thumbs up for the makers,10/10
18 November 2019,"I wish I could enjoy this as much as a lot of people seem to be doing. But I cannot see how anyone who genuinely loves the books could think this is a good adaptation. The casting is all wrong, the parts they've added seem mostly unnecessary and some of the changes are baffling. I'm sure that people who have never read the books might really enjoy this but it's not for me. I've watched three episodes. I've given it a chance but it's winding me up how different it is and how so many people are gushing over it.",3/10
4 April 2020,I really loved it... Gets more intense as it goes further. Very straight forward also.,9/10
22 December 2020,Every episode is a masterpiece with an ending that gonna blow your mind,10/10
29 November 2019,"One for book readers...I really have a problem with how they've treated Lyra's character so far (3 episodes in). Dafne Keen is an OK choice for the role, although she doesn't seem duplicitous enough for me. This may be down to how Lyra's traits from the books seem to be being written out of the show though, which is bizarre as they're what define Lyra as a character and elevate her above the typical YA fantasy protagonist. Where's all the lying, scheming, silvertongue-ness?! The party at Mrs Coulter's is a perfect example. In the show it was edited to have the journalist reveal insightful information to Lyra about the evil golden monkey harnessing b****, but in the books Lyra tricks Lord Boreal into revealing this information by using partial truths she's gathered to convincingly lie and therefore bamboozle him into spilling the beans. This is so much better! It shows who Lyra is as a character, and above all else is interesting! It was a standout moment in the book for me, and if the show runners decide to leave that out and replace it with such a 'meh' scene with a nobody journalist who's dead 5 minutes later then I have serious concerns about how they'll handle Lyra's development going forward.Also, another gripe, why reveal Grumman's identity in the third episode? That's so dumb! It's supposed to be the shock twist / big reveal at the end of The Subtle Knife! Now there will be no suspense or intrigue with Will's quest when he is (by the looks of it) prematurely introduced...",2/10
9 December 2019,"Absolutely loving the series so far!
Been reading the first book after the announcement and watched the episodes every Sunday night.The story has its mix of horror, adventure and mystery, with many enigmas that get explained later on.The dash of comedy works really well and the cast is superb, especially Lin- Manuel Miranda and Ruth Wilson.Really looking forward to the end of the series and for the next one to start next year!",10/10
13 November 2019,"If you've read the books and watch the movie of the ""The Golden Compass"". This is a cheap knock-off of both of them. It seem like they were trying to hard to make it better but the movies had the imagination of what the world with daemons would look like, just like the book. This looks more realistic than fantasy.",1/10
3 December 2019,"I am a 38 year old man who read the books as a teenager and was captivated by them.
I have read them countless times since both for my enjoyment and that of my children. The golden compass film adaptation was OK but not quite upto scratch but I loved that Sam Elliot was cast as Lee Scorsby, that was a stroke of genius.So when the BBC and HBO announced this collaboration I was of course piqued but warey.
However I'm 5 episodes in and can safely say that it's simply brilliant. The daemons are beautifully realised, the sets are stunning, the actors can act and the story is so close to the books with only necessary changes to move the plot along and fill everyone in.It feels like the world I first discovered in my teens has come to life in front of me.I look forward to more of the same and hope that they continue to faithfully present Philip Pullmans epic trilogy.",9/10

I heard of this show and was very excited to watch for this reason. Overall I enjoyed watching it, I haven't read the books and was always on edge about what's going to happen next. Can't wait for season 2! I really hope that this time the story will be told!",8/10
12 November 2019,"I've read all three books and I love them. I was so excited for the show, but this show is so horrible and boring so far. The world and CGI looks great but the casting, other than Dafne Keen, is awful, the acting is awful, and the early reveal in just episode 2 of so many different plot points that occur in the end of the first book and halfway through the second book is absurd.I'm really hoping this gets better but at this point, it's too boring to make me want to continue.",4/10
3 December 2019,"I wasn't sure if I like it at first but 2 episodes in it I was very interested in the story. Now on the 6th episode, I can't wait untill the next one comes out. Highly recommend giving this show a change.",9/10
24 November 2019,"Too all the haters.. It is obvious that you'll swallow anything Hollywood slathered with CGI throws at you (The Golden Compass) but when it comes to a true book adaptation (even with omissions and changes) you are quick to decide that something is bad while most (probably even none) of you haven't even read the books.First of all, the world we are shown is spot on. It is supposed look like this. Gritty and industrial and a bit of steampunk but set in a Similar world as ours. It's a parallel after all. Each of these worlds (which we will explore later on in the series) are unique yes, some will be completely different but Lyra's world is supposed to be akin to ours.For the people who are confused about Lord Boreal traveling between his own world and ours, this is a built up to season 2 which will cover book 2 (The Subtle Knife) (Season 1 being book 1: Northern Lights) I love how they worked his scheming which isn't really covered in the 1st book leads up to key events in book 2. It does become clear when you read the second book that he has been travelling between worlds for a while already. It is a good thing they tackled this early on instead of maybe using flash backs in season 2. But I see how this can be confusing to people who are new to His Dark Materials. As for the confusion about how he is able to travel between the 2 worlds, this will be explained in Season 2.My advice is keep an open mind and this show will surprise you.",9/10
3 December 2019,"This production is fantastic. The story, the visuals and MOST of the cast are outstanding. Unfortunately, they made a misstep by casting Dafne Keen. Her overacting and whispery, whimpering Tones has been the single cause for my desire to turn it off.
You have to anticipate a TV series being a little slow at times and relishing in the dramatic moments more than the film ""the golden compass "" but Dafne's whiny low talking makes minutes feel like hours. No doubt she has the potential of a great actress in the future, but her role in ""His Dark Materials"" is a prime example of what you get when a child is encouraged to act on the only emotion she seems to possess.",
31 December 2019,I love the movie the golden Compass. That's all this series is and if it continues it could be very good depending on how it's made.,
26 December 2019,"I cannot wait for the next season. What Imagination to come up with something so brilliant. Great cast, Great acting. Very well done. Starts slow but that is understandable given the scale. Wait till the third episode when things start to really pick up. Must watch.",10/10

30 December 2019,"Fascinating concept, poor execution. After 7/8 episodes I find many of the dialogs stylted, overly grand and just plain bad. They build up to a lot of intriguing and nerve wracking problems, only to resolve them too quickly and easily. Other series often draw out the problems so they stop the momentum, but here they resolve without really pulling us in. They don't even give it enough time to get exciting. Oh, and the styrofoam snow and lack of frost on the actors completely kills any illusion of the story taking place in the North. Disappointed.",4/10
27 November 2019,This series is a well made version of the golden compass,10/10

13 June 2021,"I read His Dark Materials trilogy few years back and I remember the excitement of turning each page and delving deeper into this beautiful, stunning world Phillip Pullman had created. It was astounding, ground breaking and dense for what apparently was a YA fiction. While the first novel itself was quite distinctive in its world building and a unique representation of magic and fantasy, it was still in essence, a children's story. Not so much with the remaining two books which started exploring darker realities and became a tour de force on religion, politics and dogma. And the books did all this without stopping the fun. Both the author and the reader enjoyed the journey.Which is the disturbing thing about the TV show. While the first season starts slowly, both a reader and a first time watcher get rewarded for the patience fairly quickly. What the show also does well is to include Will's story right from get go, which in the books happens only in the second novel. So the first season, while making it a little hum drum, was still quite enjoyable for most part. It starts and ends quite similar to the book and easily made us forget the dreadful wasted opportunity that was The Golden Compass.The second season starts with the same energy of exploring this beautiful world and adding new layers of complexity to the plot. But somewhere after the fourth episode you get a nagging feeling that the makers aren't enjoying the process of story telling. While it's still faithful to the source material (since Pullman serves as an EP as well), what was up until then juicy and fleshy, suddenly turns bone dry. Events unflod on the screen similar to how they happen in the novel but suddenly you realise, it feels like a chore. The plot starts becoming sluggish and it feels like the makers are just going through the motions to reach a point they had decided to reach at the end.Thus I ended the second season with a sense of passive dissapointnent because all the gut punching events of the story were robbed of their gravitas. Instead the show decided to focus on irony of choices each character has to make and the folly of trying to control and stay in control of the situation.Quite a drab approach for a story, which in all its grandness, was quite fun to read as well!",8/10
15 August 2020,"I ve read a book and it was A class book but when I ve been watching this show I was very upset. It so bad TV show.
